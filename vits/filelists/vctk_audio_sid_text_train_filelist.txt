DUMMY2/p282/p282_147.wav|83|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_402.wav|6|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_099.wav|71|"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_160.wav|15|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_166.wav|26|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_335.wav|74|The government agreed to pay.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_373.wav|4|And then he laughs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_092.wav|60|It was looking bad.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_361.wav|98|But this relative success has not been easy.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_225.wav|43|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_191.wav|13|I have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_378.wav|72|Well, what can you do?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_046.wav|15|The cause is just.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_362.wav|46|And we're talking Big Money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_161.wav|24|Life is still very tough for them.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_122.wav|44|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_247.wav|82|No injuries were reported.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_288.wav|90|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_102.wav|27|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_037.wav|36|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_391.wav|11|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_261.wav|67|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_119.wav|16|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_091.wav|76|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_288.wav|52|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_008.wav|39|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_366.wav|82|I said at the time it was wrong.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_213.wav|95|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_032.wav|29|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_405.wav|64|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_408.wav|11|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_027.wav|77|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_038.wav|61|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_121.wav|99|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_293.wav|92|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_351.wav|10|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_464.wav|50|Driving has been the key.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_081.wav|82|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_373.wav|78|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_049.wav|91|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_088.wav|58|A decision is expected today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_318.wav|100|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_248.wav|100|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_094.wav|20|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_434.wav|8|The British government does not want to know.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_129.wav|64|He was back to square one.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_174.wav|79|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_267.wav|84|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_058.wav|45|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_238.wav|17|Last year was not a good year.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_222.wav|92|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_277.wav|79|We are in this for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_252.wav|0|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_208.wav|5|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_353.wav|87|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_352.wav|15|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_071.wav|39|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_430.wav|48|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_437.wav|39|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_375.wav|94|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_197.wav|5|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_223.wav|62|He is a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_351.wav|39|Overall, we are very pleased.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_378.wav|42|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_486.wav|48|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_385.wav|16|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_295.wav|41|That could change.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_265.wav|84|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_399.wav|14|Ferguson must take the blame.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_344.wav|65|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_375.wav|105|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_059.wav|85|It doesn't look as pretty.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_316.wav|90|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_249.wav|39|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_325.wav|84|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_092.wav|23|I seem to keep this for the majors.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_217.wav|19|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_208.wav|47|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_072.wav|33|I feel alive and good today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_371.wav|28|That's always the case, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_186.wav|103|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_304.wav|27|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_106.wav|100|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_146.wav|31|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_190.wav|61|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_139.wav|82|They were part of our own family.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_253.wav|89|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_286.wav|44|We have been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_139.wav|60|Elections would follow in about two years.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_409.wav|66|He needs to be.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_240.wav|29|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_029.wav|67|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_133.wav|106|No one person or small group could be singled out.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_011.wav|55|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_083.wav|100|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_396.wav|64|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_006.wav|5|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_277.wav|102|Tourism continues to struggle.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_319.wav|104|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_148.wav|95|He was a home referee.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_198.wav|3|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_282.wav|69|It was good.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_015.wav|9|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_074.wav|93|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_038.wav|58|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_343.wav|72|There wasn't anything in it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_028.wav|52|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_243.wav|3|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_390.wav|70|I've had my time.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_259.wav|49|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_003.wav|20|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_236.wav|48|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_267.wav|59|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_384.wav|42|I'm not sure.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_405.wav|19|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_004.wav|68|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_090.wav|101|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_150.wav|99|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_037.wav|24|Rugby has an extended run.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_168.wav|16|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_334.wav|47|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_339.wav|67|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_343.wav|78|Something is going to have to give.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_266.wav|23|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_167.wav|97|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_438.wav|24|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_229.wav|51|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_370.wav|72|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_397.wav|28|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_268.wav|99|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_373.wav|105|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_027.wav|92|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_094.wav|30|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_017.wav|39|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_419.wav|49|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_146.wav|72|This is a total mystery.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_004.wav|55|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_114.wav|62|Where do you think she is going?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_246.wav|83|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_326.wav|31|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_029.wav|45|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_238.wav|12|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_323.wav|37|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_457.wav|50|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_094.wav|79|They just have a go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_310.wav|33|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_096.wav|12|They told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_206.wav|76|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_187.wav|61|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_346.wav|25|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_051.wav|76|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_268.wav|68|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_032.wav|102|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_118.wav|104|We are the weakest link.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_351.wav|61|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_219.wav|66|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_215.wav|96|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_087.wav|67|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_355.wav|36|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_249.wav|94|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_284.wav|85|The change was not instant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_127.wav|48|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_347.wav|19|This morning was very quiet.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_470.wav|95|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_139.wav|39|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_189.wav|25|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_399.wav|96|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_412.wav|56|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_046.wav|16|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_349.wav|62|Parents should avoid it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_216.wav|0|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_229.wav|46|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_230.wav|19|She asked us a lot of questions.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_084.wav|99|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_234.wav|91|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_447.wav|95|Something has got to give.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_306.wav|81|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_171.wav|21|It has been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_194.wav|96|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_341.wav|75|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_088.wav|49|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_094.wav|65|What is the wife?)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_180.wav|96|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_258.wav|55|It was an accident.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_132.wav|30|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_333.wav|56|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_245.wav|26|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_163.wav|86|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_259.wav|47|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_190.wav|105|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_139.wav|99|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_149.wav|49|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_247.wav|67|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_161.wav|67|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_066.wav|101|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_156.wav|4|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_203.wav|37|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_013.wav|78|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_340.wav|92|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_204.wav|22|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_298.wav|46|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_096.wav|27|This one did.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_267.wav|24|We've had several problems over injuries.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_148.wav|66|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_193.wav|25|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_078.wav|17|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_397.wav|85|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_140.wav|87|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_107.wav|68|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_139.wav|96|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_052.wav|73|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_316.wav|83|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_214.wav|103|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_422.wav|51|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_181.wav|48|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_266.wav|49|I think we've got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_222.wav|26|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_271.wav|72|Are we going to stay up?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_280.wav|97|It was always open for extension.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_313.wav|36|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_172.wav|92|You're not going to forget something like that.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_374.wav|100|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_021.wav|64|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_387.wav|55|It's clearly a budget.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_259.wav|98|I'm happy that we have agreed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_194.wav|50|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_221.wav|23|It will take some time to establish.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_457.wav|24|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_174.wav|80|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_152.wav|45|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_138.wav|28|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_357.wav|79|We had no idea what was going on.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_094.wav|71|"The selection process is still at a very early stage."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_251.wav|77|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_001.wav|90|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_218.wav|41|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_123.wav|42|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_152.wav|19|I am ashamed of them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_399.wav|8|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_224.wav|57|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_020.wav|88|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_408.wav|51|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_205.wav|23|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_134.wav|33|We can play better than that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_422.wav|17|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_063.wav|48|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_008.wav|64|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_300.wav|38|It's a sign of the times.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_109.wav|96|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_327.wav|62|There is still hope.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_298.wav|0|It is inherent in society.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_377.wav|27|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_208.wav|15|It was crucial strike.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_350.wav|101|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_119.wav|18|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_219.wav|46|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_426.wav|7|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_217.wav|72|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_155.wav|3|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_399.wav|16|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_336.wav|97|She was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_390.wav|78|He was on a mission.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_347.wav|55|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_317.wav|85|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_286.wav|35|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_147.wav|22|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_348.wav|20|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_392.wav|41|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_141.wav|49|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_158.wav|71|"My Dad is a hero."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_210.wav|92|And what is she escaping from?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_268.wav|24|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_028.wav|23|All my training is for Athens.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_056.wav|78|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_337.wav|36|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_192.wav|79|Failure is not an option.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_230.wav|107|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_317.wav|3|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_340.wav|33|So we talked about that for a bit.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_359.wav|68|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_107.wav|75|They will notice a difference.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_291.wav|64|It is just too long since the war.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_101.wav|44|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_201.wav|5|I will win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_019.wav|39|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_362.wav|10|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_054.wav|74|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_281.wav|70|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_307.wav|86|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_352.wav|69|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_109.wav|30|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_297.wav|56|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_170.wav|73|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_032.wav|50|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_049.wav|86|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_146.wav|1|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_034.wav|8|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_047.wav|30|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_075.wav|26|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_200.wav|96|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_084.wav|71|"That will come after the game on Saturday."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_057.wav|2|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_402.wav|106|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_198.wav|55|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_311.wav|39|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_157.wav|72|My goal was very important to the team.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_312.wav|16|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_300.wav|61|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_007.wav|15|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_391.wav|92|Our position is not a logic of war.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_389.wav|91|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_075.wav|102|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_214.wav|5|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_044.wav|38|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_221.wav|80|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_147.wav|4|I believe in trade unions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_054.wav|44|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_305.wav|0|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_403.wav|51|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_055.wav|21|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_310.wav|39|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_022.wav|30|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_178.wav|5|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_171.wav|53|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_106.wav|41|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_100.wav|77|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_099.wav|73|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_334.wav|69|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_182.wav|7|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_002.wav|16|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_252.wav|33|Now we are back on top of Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_313.wav|106|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_142.wav|27|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_114.wav|8|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_207.wav|33|Six years is too long.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_240.wav|106|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_122.wav|82|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_346.wav|43|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_102.wav|68|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_130.wav|28|It's about attitudes to change.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_123.wav|10|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_179.wav|70|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_281.wav|48|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_212.wav|96|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_040.wav|43|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_030.wav|74|We've not won anything yet.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_206.wav|65|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_191.wav|38|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_384.wav|53|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_038.wav|16|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_318.wav|94|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_077.wav|35|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_192.wav|11|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_270.wav|84|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_289.wav|36|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_087.wav|92|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_342.wav|37|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_227.wav|4|Those Were The Days, indeed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_479.wav|75|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_065.wav|84|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_088.wav|2|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_018.wav|62|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_158.wav|73|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_297.wav|68|That is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_063.wav|82|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_467.wav|75|It can all be done over the phone.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_015.wav|48|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_216.wav|85|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_342.wav|23|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_063.wav|63|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_348.wav|47|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_380.wav|105|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_094.wav|49|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_340.wav|48|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_169.wav|37|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_034.wav|9|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_249.wav|93|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_232.wav|0|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_314.wav|74|I have still to hear about that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_205.wav|1|Only the scale of change differed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_134.wav|35|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_155.wav|32|The danger is always there.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_192.wav|41|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_121.wav|64|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_079.wav|74|He is now back in Britain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_186.wav|70|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_347.wav|84|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_130.wav|32|That would open the gates of hell.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_063.wav|101|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_159.wav|62|The world is being invited to visit.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_311.wav|43|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_161.wav|27|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_012.wav|102|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_259.wav|104|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_107.wav|31|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_455.wav|14|People are so negative about the whole business.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_082.wav|49|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_241.wav|2|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_278.wav|34|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_111.wav|6|We are making no comment.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_090.wav|3|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_303.wav|27|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_243.wav|45|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_162.wav|65|It is just too tough.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_107.wav|102|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_279.wav|82|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_029.wav|40|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_337.wav|98|Wouldn't it be nice?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_282.wav|85|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_156.wav|93|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_165.wav|58|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_300.wav|53|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_397.wav|6|You can't take a chance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_133.wav|27|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_045.wav|86|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_046.wav|101|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_270.wav|86|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_157.wav|48|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_449.wav|106|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_375.wav|95|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_080.wav|90|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_453.wav|95|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_305.wav|45|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_396.wav|20|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_338.wav|100|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_036.wav|88|It was very moving, actually.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_396.wav|46|Completion is expected by October the following year.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_285.wav|83|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_390.wav|102|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_352.wav|55|No sport needs that sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_388.wav|91|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_242.wav|2|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_301.wav|76|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_367.wav|87|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_051.wav|51|I'm feeling pretty good.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_140.wav|49|Don't even bother applying.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_235.wav|79|That would end it for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_337.wav|74|It was a very terrible thing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_277.wav|93|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_335.wav|21|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_168.wav|0|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_263.wav|40|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_284.wav|21|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_075.wav|104|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_004.wav|83|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_185.wav|72|There were so many characters among them.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_369.wav|2|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_235.wav|16|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_032.wav|59|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_200.wav|94|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_232.wav|62|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_270.wav|85|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_066.wav|77|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_201.wav|22|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_052.wav|79|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_412.wav|62|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_191.wav|24|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_290.wav|99|IT S all in the hair.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_234.wav|40|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_050.wav|81|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_279.wav|54|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_192.wav|107|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_421.wav|17|So he should be.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_286.wav|63|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_413.wav|77|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_264.wav|17|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_163.wav|88|There was nothing anyone could do.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_243.wav|65|Eight months later, he was dead.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_257.wav|107|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_152.wav|46|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_367.wav|25|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_155.wav|9|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_116.wav|15|He is involved in everything.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_042.wav|56|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_275.wav|97|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_364.wav|79|It's going to happen.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_114.wav|55|So they should be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_386.wav|75|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_119.wav|26|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_284.wav|7|It makes no difference to their friendship.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_140.wav|28|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_307.wav|64|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_334.wav|45|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_180.wav|46|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_316.wav|78|It involved the same people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_177.wav|76|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_192.wav|70|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_054.wav|48|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_380.wav|31|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_386.wav|36|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_390.wav|107|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_440.wav|24|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_153.wav|10|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_103.wav|83|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_243.wav|78|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_209.wav|90|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_314.wav|19|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_288.wav|60|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_094.wav|62|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_264.wav|69|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_017.wav|30|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_386.wav|24|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_339.wav|47|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_117.wav|35|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_325.wav|3|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_151.wav|28|But what will we put on it?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_250.wav|83|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_178.wav|32|was everything done to save people ?)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_214.wav|43|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_373.wav|96|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_065.wav|96|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_259.wav|10|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_062.wav|17|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_147.wav|51|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_283.wav|80|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_404.wav|97|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_203.wav|59|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_060.wav|36|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_217.wav|9|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_125.wav|88|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_004.wav|77|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_418.wav|75|I think it's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_244.wav|15|We don't want to be too intrusive.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_093.wav|57|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_163.wav|78|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_164.wav|33|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_168.wav|52|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_064.wav|36|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_197.wav|65|Is it worth it?)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_245.wav|45|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_218.wav|40|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_289.wav|40|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_228.wav|35|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_348.wav|70|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_057.wav|72|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_037.wav|7|Child benefit will not be affected.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_207.wav|27|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_381.wav|39|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_282.wav|45|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_310.wav|65|He left pretty quickly.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_188.wav|76|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_180.wav|17|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_103.wav|79|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_195.wav|38|We may make a short-term appointment.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_121.wav|91|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_160.wav|4|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_220.wav|38|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_187.wav|103|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_384.wav|0|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_033.wav|33|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_145.wav|5|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_284.wav|72|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_068.wav|25|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_005.wav|90|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_108.wav|34|I've had a very long run.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_180.wav|106|It was a sobering experience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_301.wav|32|And we were very lucky.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_216.wav|78|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_059.wav|93|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_210.wav|49|John Lennon is a very large industry.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_402.wav|76|This fight is not going to go away.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_186.wav|106|The festivals will be about having fun.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_403.wav|26|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_044.wav|11|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_207.wav|85|Both men were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_341.wav|33|But he has strong links to Labour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_185.wav|22|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_317.wav|38|It seems a little short to me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_244.wav|30|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_050.wav|67|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_199.wav|103|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_290.wav|92|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_393.wav|48|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_042.wav|106|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_338.wav|96|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_246.wav|53|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_176.wav|52|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_367.wav|1|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_135.wav|44|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_265.wav|59|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_290.wav|94|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_082.wav|53|It's been a great evening for us.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_406.wav|103|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_024.wav|6|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_233.wav|91|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_154.wav|12|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_284.wav|76|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_279.wav|43|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_117.wav|96|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_045.wav|8|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_082.wav|10|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_304.wav|35|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_150.wav|23|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_151.wav|68|It is always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_114.wav|104|The industry will try to get round it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_119.wav|81|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_180.wav|67|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_291.wav|87|When she went off it was quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_026.wav|101|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_135.wav|19|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_159.wav|101|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_182.wav|26|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_129.wav|28|This is not a long-term commitment.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_211.wav|80|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_175.wav|72|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_379.wav|60|It meant a lot to us.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_172.wav|47|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_250.wav|73|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_039.wav|104|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_200.wav|7|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_393.wav|104|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_455.wav|65|They thought he was asking the right questions.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_123.wav|12|This is not understood by people outside.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_095.wav|3|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_075.wav|47|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_374.wav|39|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_254.wav|48|She replied, It could be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_354.wav|20|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_072.wav|32|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_268.wav|76|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_383.wav|19|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_269.wav|46|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_163.wav|50|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_287.wav|80|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_144.wav|53|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_281.wav|24|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_068.wav|28|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_330.wav|17|It is a high time to act.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_189.wav|27|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_334.wav|13|This country has many challenges.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_083.wav|99|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_037.wav|5|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_303.wav|17|And there is no cause for it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_014.wav|47|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_016.wav|83|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_083.wav|98|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_299.wav|12|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_106.wav|76|However, he added there were signs of progress.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_149.wav|3|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_160.wav|29|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_277.wav|72|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_281.wav|107|We've taken steps to rectify it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_027.wav|75|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_324.wav|105|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_078.wav|13|THERE's only one word for it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_166.wav|3|At the moment we do not understand it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_313.wav|25|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_193.wav|53|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_161.wav|40|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_234.wav|28|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_449.wav|39|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_031.wav|100|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_427.wav|40|He deserved a red card.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_335.wav|23|They had asked not to be named.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_428.wav|65|I have to protect them.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_179.wav|99|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_194.wav|15|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_153.wav|103|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_154.wav|77|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_281.wav|49|Government sources said, It is building up.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_112.wav|16|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_274.wav|8|Or was it ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_368.wav|28|It's hard not to.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_064.wav|24|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_367.wav|52|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_057.wav|98|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_144.wav|88|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_092.wav|67|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_349.wav|89|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_051.wav|79|They were taken to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_092.wav|87|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_206.wav|48|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_153.wav|45|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_144.wav|90|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_197.wav|82|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_065.wav|102|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_001.wav|71|"Please call Stella.  "
DUMMY2/p247/p247_427.wav|14|My aim is a top six finish.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_255.wav|76|Our people are paying high prices.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_353.wav|63|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_434.wav|36|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_007.wav|27|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_166.wav|32|They had been forced to walk.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_121.wav|28|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_103.wav|56|We deserve a significant rise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_278.wav|92|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_004.wav|38|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_148.wav|39|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_265.wav|12|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_092.wav|49|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_145.wav|75|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_027.wav|58|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_211.wav|63|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_298.wav|82|This could prove a problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_030.wav|19|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_406.wav|65|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_191.wav|28|I feel really good.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_376.wav|98|At this point we can only speculate.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_421.wav|97|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_119.wav|105|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_013.wav|98|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_020.wav|4|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_326.wav|21|It is time, he said.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_290.wav|107|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_418.wav|18|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_297.wav|53|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_067.wav|19|Sandy was very active.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_219.wav|100|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_019.wav|106|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_150.wav|93|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_132.wav|11|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_023.wav|95|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_137.wav|27|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_370.wav|43|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_238.wav|91|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_037.wav|57|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_175.wav|2|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_134.wav|36|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_001.wav|2|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_108.wav|97|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_107.wav|35|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_155.wav|16|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_074.wav|72|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_003.wav|31|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_254.wav|91|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_397.wav|68|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_014.wav|98|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_079.wav|83|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_370.wav|50|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_121.wav|50|I was just a child.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_245.wav|74|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_240.wav|61|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_087.wav|59|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_188.wav|89|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_252.wav|60|But it was too late.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_287.wav|62|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_380.wav|17|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_219.wav|28|We're playing away from home and that's it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_269.wav|51|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_060.wav|44|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_181.wav|66|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_186.wav|52|A great player has to win major championships.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_189.wav|48|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_313.wav|18|No-one can take it in.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_335.wav|19|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_131.wav|37|This is a sizeable part of our business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_063.wav|36|The standard is extremely high.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_309.wav|46|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_368.wav|35|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_038.wav|8|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_241.wav|15|But we are working together for this result.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_052.wav|93|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_403.wav|40|It might be.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_110.wav|56|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_082.wav|62|It was all very proper and civilised.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_278.wav|26|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_138.wav|3|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_314.wav|58|She was just that sort of person.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_249.wav|50|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_082.wav|3|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_387.wav|105|So I did.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_283.wav|47|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_322.wav|38|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_027.wav|57|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_206.wav|43|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_298.wav|17|We had no part in it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_317.wav|10|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_212.wav|89|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_447.wav|48|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_256.wav|22|Wanger was never like this.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_288.wav|20|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_183.wav|71|"I saw military vehicles in the distance."
DUMMY2/p308/p308_316.wav|107|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_308.wav|83|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_043.wav|92|It's just not our biggest problem.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_213.wav|54|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_195.wav|101|It is hard to tell.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_205.wav|4|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_238.wav|64|It's something we want to make work.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_156.wav|69|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_002.wav|38|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_085.wav|84|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_154.wav|20|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_176.wav|28|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_181.wav|68|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_252.wav|107|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_108.wav|89|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_204.wav|16|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_262.wav|78|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_396.wav|23|I should never have come over to Fife.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_104.wav|8|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_310.wav|50|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_173.wav|29|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_234.wav|64|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_203.wav|19|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_068.wav|74|It is time for the talking to stop.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_281.wav|98|There is no easy answer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_412.wav|47|That may be.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_107.wav|49|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_248.wav|103|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_283.wav|63|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_135.wav|49|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_351.wav|4|It is physical but it is also good.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_406.wav|35|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_343.wav|77|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_168.wav|99|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_262.wav|69|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_123.wav|29|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_084.wav|16|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_119.wav|100|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_169.wav|0|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_128.wav|46|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_112.wav|70|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_208.wav|53|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_190.wav|65|The questions came quick and fast.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_180.wav|94|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_190.wav|47|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_089.wav|71|"The oil companies would be asked to contribute."
DUMMY2/p318/p318_165.wav|19|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_074.wav|36|The players will be down.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_354.wav|0|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_174.wav|31|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_200.wav|61|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_401.wav|74|There was much to be positive about.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_357.wav|0|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_300.wav|62|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_059.wav|46|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_036.wav|27|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_147.wav|77|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_189.wav|43|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_201.wav|18|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_313.wav|43|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_244.wav|67|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_353.wav|82|It was a very big win for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_047.wav|29|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_013.wav|54|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_263.wav|91|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_141.wav|45|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_222.wav|17|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_173.wav|103|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_315.wav|96|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_272.wav|14|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_043.wav|18|I said to him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_359.wav|41|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_204.wav|56|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_405.wav|70|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_182.wav|10|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_059.wav|27|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_009.wav|53|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_099.wav|80|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_333.wav|66|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_279.wav|19|Why should he go anywhere?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_053.wav|64|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_088.wav|3|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_373.wav|32|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_309.wav|69|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_030.wav|45|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_378.wav|63|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_069.wav|83|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_016.wav|4|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_166.wav|79|Those are difficult decisions.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_030.wav|40|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_141.wav|87|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_348.wav|16|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_157.wav|91|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_120.wav|79|I am not very pleased.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_012.wav|107|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_198.wav|48|He said the director had been completely friendly.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_339.wav|82|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_120.wav|37|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_174.wav|84|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_230.wav|2|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_205.wav|20|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_326.wav|49|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_343.wav|42|The girls are ready to compete.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_267.wav|22|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_341.wav|8|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_223.wav|40|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_322.wav|106|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_032.wav|65|He added that her comments were noted.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_002.wav|102|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_159.wav|99|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_244.wav|79|Sadly it is a mess.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_259.wav|73|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_175.wav|99|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_019.wav|93|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_277.wav|107|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_144.wav|21|But not all were so defiant.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_318.wav|47|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_182.wav|27|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_182.wav|34|He was married with children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_214.wav|82|It happens in real life.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_082.wav|8|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_310.wav|78|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_193.wav|8|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_214.wav|99|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_011.wav|37|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_166.wav|84|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_243.wav|37|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_435.wav|39|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_144.wav|39|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_283.wav|17|We're going to change our party.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_220.wav|32|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_034.wav|50|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_379.wav|13|That's not like us at all.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_002.wav|41|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_119.wav|22|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_199.wav|26|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_245.wav|80|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_037.wav|23|I have got to adopt the same approach.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_392.wav|98|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_326.wav|93|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_050.wav|59|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_175.wav|13|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_126.wav|52|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_320.wav|38|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_064.wav|1|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_370.wav|15|Plot is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_285.wav|107|Others said they had been beaten by police.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_107.wav|71|"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_115.wav|59|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_454.wav|36|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_008.wav|88|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_311.wav|73|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_355.wav|99|That would help.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_181.wav|33|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_270.wav|69|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_363.wav|68|Would he be able to live with that?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_288.wav|34|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_420.wav|79|We certainly do not intend to disband.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_232.wav|98|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_024.wav|94|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_041.wav|83|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_286.wav|30|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_390.wav|34|There is great interest on our island.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_284.wav|63|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_161.wav|106|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_388.wav|29|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_224.wav|100|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_002.wav|57|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_478.wav|7|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_217.wav|100|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_165.wav|0|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_181.wav|97|I'll just do my best.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_367.wav|4|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_105.wav|52|I bought a flat six years ago.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_340.wav|97|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_197.wav|31|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_315.wav|17|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_159.wav|33|The whole thing in general is moving on.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_252.wav|24|The most important thing is the game.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_267.wav|50|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_163.wav|102|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_232.wav|14|We played them off the pitch.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_066.wav|28|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_280.wav|16|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_312.wav|3|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_377.wav|53|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_316.wav|95|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_228.wav|39|We can hardly talk about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_187.wav|62|We played too deeply.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_232.wav|33|Perhaps that was their mistake.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_389.wav|29|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_189.wav|4|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_179.wav|21|This has been very frustrating for him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_302.wav|16|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_160.wav|99|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_193.wav|22|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_172.wav|107|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_192.wav|42|We've never seen so many.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_052.wav|16|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_491.wav|48|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_456.wav|89|If they don't, they should say so.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_228.wav|37|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_161.wav|20|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_223.wav|64|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_462.wav|7|We put our bid in last night.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_377.wav|96|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_167.wav|84|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_288.wav|71|"He should have won."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_083.wav|5|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_143.wav|100|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_406.wav|91|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_151.wav|95|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_319.wav|58|It was chaotic and frightening.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_122.wav|96|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_299.wav|1|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_228.wav|81|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_265.wav|98|There is no point in denying that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_380.wav|103|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_299.wav|57|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_332.wav|99|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_386.wav|104|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_272.wav|3|We want this place to work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_049.wav|33|He met his wife and married in England.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_125.wav|102|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_320.wav|94|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_159.wav|16|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_226.wav|35|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_291.wav|76|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_421.wav|46|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_060.wav|63|We would have concerns about suspension.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_128.wav|103|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_024.wav|101|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_382.wav|60|This country has many challenges.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_300.wav|91|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_359.wav|92|You are always aware of the injury potential.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_018.wav|95|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_065.wav|30|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_115.wav|89|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_400.wav|15|You hope he prevails.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_327.wav|64|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_172.wav|35|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_014.wav|19|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_468.wav|39|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_414.wav|62|The proposals have been taken out of context.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_271.wav|76|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_137.wav|85|He is a bully.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_035.wav|92|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_315.wav|51|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_297.wav|76|What's the point of staying sober?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_150.wav|24|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_031.wav|75|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_192.wav|80|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_409.wav|24|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_168.wav|73|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_198.wav|16|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_161.wav|76|I can make one further announcement.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_095.wav|91|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_334.wav|39|There is no plan B.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_258.wav|62|The claim was denied by first minister.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_161.wav|17|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_189.wav|55|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_351.wav|65|He is fully fit.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_250.wav|52|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_311.wav|3|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_225.wav|49|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_024.wav|31|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_293.wav|102|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_409.wav|64|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_054.wav|39|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_302.wav|36|Scotch beef is badly missed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_377.wav|98|We know we have the quality.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_210.wav|47|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_393.wav|32|The law would appear to be on our side.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_310.wav|80|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_231.wav|12|We have tried to keep his head up.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_022.wav|28|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_258.wav|84|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_193.wav|24|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_278.wav|53|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_336.wav|99|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_098.wav|38|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_091.wav|100|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_071.wav|14|Final proposals will be published in February.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_351.wav|106|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_392.wav|36|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_197.wav|90|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_381.wav|69|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_120.wav|107|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_076.wav|33|His track record is impressive.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_210.wav|53|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_046.wav|48|But not a penny has been paid.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_244.wav|68|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_235.wav|23|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_106.wav|70|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_082.wav|37|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_329.wav|80|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_135.wav|27|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_141.wav|26|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_301.wav|24|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_370.wav|69|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_171.wav|40|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_300.wav|98|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_327.wav|32|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_195.wav|91|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_065.wav|52|Indeed he has a lot of output.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_144.wav|58|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_118.wav|81|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_317.wav|15|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_083.wav|1|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_123.wav|28|That is a data management problem.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_353.wav|15|The incident is dead.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_465.wav|39|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_499.wav|48|I am not unduly surprised.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_350.wav|26|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_290.wav|20|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_097.wav|90|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_173.wav|10|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_354.wav|76|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_185.wav|107|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_157.wav|51|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_035.wav|88|It shouldn't be a problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_295.wav|104|They've got a mountain to climb.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_272.wav|76|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_243.wav|99|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_353.wav|64|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_330.wav|83|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_146.wav|23|Perhaps it should stay there.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_239.wav|27|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_472.wav|39|It's just a place to open it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_418.wav|16|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_043.wav|51|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_029.wav|61|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_051.wav|69|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_092.wav|35|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_240.wav|2|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_033.wav|70|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_403.wav|96|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_186.wav|30|They have two children.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_283.wav|14|They must play for each other.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_412.wav|98|He wants the festival to make a difference.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_146.wav|91|You hope he prevails.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_379.wav|74|It feels like a winner already.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_296.wav|93|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_305.wav|67|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_395.wav|69|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_292.wav|74|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_082.wav|71|"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats."
DUMMY2/p304/p304_380.wav|72|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_419.wav|56|That's been all around Europe with me.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_237.wav|59|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_291.wav|29|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_354.wav|55|Any increase always has some effect.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_380.wav|27|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_146.wav|34|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_302.wav|76|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_047.wav|13|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_055.wav|3|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_260.wav|76|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_318.wav|3|The existing structure is in trouble.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_095.wav|102|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_161.wav|26|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_035.wav|5|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_119.wav|8|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_220.wav|51|She was an only child.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_375.wav|49|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_168.wav|46|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_417.wav|20|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_135.wav|51|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_200.wav|65|At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_116.wav|101|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_289.wav|20|It was good.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_140.wav|51|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_208.wav|42|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_045.wav|81|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_277.wav|39|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_035.wav|58|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_074.wav|71|"She died in hospital two hours later."
DUMMY2/p334/p334_391.wav|38|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_188.wav|92|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_314.wav|52|He felt too close to head office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_274.wav|6|His funeral is not expected until next week.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_300.wav|8|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_330.wav|54|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_195.wav|75|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_035.wav|45|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_320.wav|8|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_078.wav|79|As it should be.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_174.wav|32|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_062.wav|80|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_281.wav|25|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_120.wav|19|The Tory party will last.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_295.wav|39|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_164.wav|5|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_139.wav|18|How can they tell?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_132.wav|10|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_424.wav|18|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_075.wav|20|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_155.wav|33|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_187.wav|64|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_259.wav|105|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_347.wav|74|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_060.wav|87|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_175.wav|66|Of course he is.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_353.wav|48|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_236.wav|5|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_247.wav|44|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_343.wav|81|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_052.wav|87|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_227.wav|73|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_103.wav|64|Maybe he will act again.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_047.wav|45|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_321.wav|13|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_085.wav|68|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_119.wav|35|But this time we can have no excuses.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_131.wav|81|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_216.wav|52|I am not going to judge them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_256.wav|59|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_126.wav|1|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_018.wav|18|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_365.wav|60|She has never been back.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_034.wav|60|For once he was wrong.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_070.wav|94|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_432.wav|14|It was a breathtaking moment.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_056.wav|93|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_002.wav|19|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_192.wav|26|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_448.wav|48|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_312.wav|2|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_150.wav|33|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_349.wav|55|Maybe she is right.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_225.wav|25|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_033.wav|13|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_341.wav|19|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_153.wav|34|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_198.wav|21|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_383.wav|4|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_084.wav|102|Why did they let him go?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_087.wav|24|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_386.wav|98|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_168.wav|24|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_385.wav|25|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_382.wav|33|They were just too good for us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_337.wav|79|What a difference a game can make.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_079.wav|62|The goal will come.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_106.wav|17|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_101.wav|27|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_313.wav|10|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_117.wav|74|We have got to the top.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_304.wav|104|Could it have been better spent?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_420.wav|60|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_008.wav|53|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_090.wav|103|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_228.wav|83|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_305.wav|34|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_152.wav|71|"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_188.wav|71|"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_241.wav|31|It is mainstream.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_013.wav|35|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_335.wav|17|There was barely a handful of chances.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_403.wav|46|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_159.wav|25|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_263.wav|75|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_141.wav|35|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_211.wav|13|People have no chance of getting out.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_007.wav|9|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_247.wav|84|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_266.wav|64|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_056.wav|63|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_349.wav|2|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_204.wav|104|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_318.wav|64|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_009.wav|82|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_078.wav|76|We are confident of taking that back.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_144.wav|59|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_017.wav|78|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_212.wav|87|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_159.wav|79|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_219.wav|23|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_315.wav|9|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_056.wav|100|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_032.wav|51|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_069.wav|104|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_146.wav|54|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_319.wav|4|It's a big challenge for the audience.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_252.wav|16|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_445.wav|27|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_360.wav|2|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_131.wav|5|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_059.wav|8|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_151.wav|53|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_112.wav|90|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_247.wav|14|I am not going to go tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_224.wav|18|What's it about?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_376.wav|31|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_213.wav|56|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_158.wav|91|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_106.wav|59|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_283.wav|29|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_343.wav|33|I am a doctor.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_026.wav|36|They are very clever in their use of words.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_081.wav|24|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_062.wav|100|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_320.wav|22|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_085.wav|18|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_120.wav|30|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_220.wav|28|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_232.wav|10|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_297.wav|29|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_344.wav|45|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_258.wav|43|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_152.wav|31|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_360.wav|85|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_289.wav|30|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_151.wav|69|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_323.wav|102|I don't know what he was capable of.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_239.wav|59|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_130.wav|71|"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_263.wav|10|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_117.wav|17|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_153.wav|90|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_398.wav|41|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_266.wav|35|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_046.wav|54|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_049.wav|56|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_211.wav|107|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_078.wav|61|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_322.wav|16|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_165.wav|85|It's got to be in the head.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_335.wav|103|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_160.wav|1|A report will be issued by March.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_269.wav|71|"People have no choice."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_272.wav|98|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_482.wav|75|Winning a medal is a dream.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_183.wav|68|Two men have been charged with his murder.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_129.wav|5|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_061.wav|65|So, did she meet him?)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_338.wav|46|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_093.wav|90|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_103.wav|35|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_351.wav|9|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_005.wav|107|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_155.wav|90|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_164.wav|29|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_048.wav|40|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_083.wav|65|Now comes the hard part.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_400.wav|13|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_198.wav|24|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_028.wav|64|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_010.wav|95|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_011.wav|86|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_144.wav|93|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_231.wav|15|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_176.wav|3|I was in a hole.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_038.wav|106|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_142.wav|2|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_080.wav|28|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_360.wav|68|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_395.wav|2|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_090.wav|73|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_417.wav|76|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_359.wav|22|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_023.wav|44|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_398.wav|100|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_205.wav|14|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_085.wav|70|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_077.wav|105|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_283.wav|62|We could do a lot worse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_187.wav|68|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_075.wav|62|Were they under-age?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_113.wav|92|It offers a different viewpoint.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_173.wav|30|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_318.wav|26|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_367.wav|95|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_240.wav|100|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_114.wav|42|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_220.wav|26|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_034.wav|92|We thought we would never see them again.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_410.wav|78|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_240.wav|27|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_314.wav|60|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_135.wav|64|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_350.wav|36|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_196.wav|92|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_140.wav|57|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_099.wav|60|It was the dreaded sentence.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_294.wav|42|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_320.wav|106|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_304.wav|94|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_151.wav|92|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_131.wav|97|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_257.wav|41|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_281.wav|77|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_102.wav|10|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_316.wav|34|The council's concern is very simple.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_055.wav|107|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_245.wav|93|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_332.wav|8|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_408.wav|15|He declined to be more specific.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_017.wav|91|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_376.wav|26|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_238.wav|34|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_089.wav|101|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_149.wav|85|I hope it is a good omen.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_312.wav|12|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_258.wav|98|When will you listen?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_082.wav|7|The city council is a major property owner in the area.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_136.wav|11|Does it make a profit?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_395.wav|104|The council's concern is very simple.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_271.wav|103|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_419.wav|50|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_061.wav|99|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_295.wav|6|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_136.wav|67|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_036.wav|86|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_222.wav|82|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_358.wav|40|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_026.wav|59|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_013.wav|41|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_350.wav|37|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_006.wav|91|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_189.wav|61|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_185.wav|88|There are two offerings from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_101.wav|99|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_278.wav|28|Which is a shame.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_152.wav|56|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_228.wav|100|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_014.wav|59|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_214.wav|25|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_146.wav|53|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_123.wav|24|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_354.wav|26|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_184.wav|21|Footage has been passed on to the police.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_312.wav|49|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_067.wav|46|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_335.wav|28|We have now no choice.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_309.wav|84|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_340.wav|25|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_417.wav|18|They are looking for partners.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_125.wav|60|It was all very good stuff.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_141.wav|39|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_362.wav|36|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_060.wav|79|We will be patient but we will win.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_333.wav|2|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_161.wav|69|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_100.wav|51|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_283.wav|19|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_286.wav|4|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_120.wav|41|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_011.wav|32|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p294/p294_033.wav|104|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_366.wav|62|You've gotten all the facts.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_037.wav|44|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_321.wav|102|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_324.wav|69|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_315.wav|105|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_203.wav|68|You can be sure we will have problems.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_214.wav|80|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_243.wav|14|They have to be able to play the game.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_401.wav|62|We must do well in that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_235.wav|103|This is my new career.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_043.wav|3|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_040.wav|90|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_323.wav|105|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_043.wav|83|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_378.wav|92|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_097.wav|82|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_115.wav|40|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_196.wav|5|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_273.wav|107|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_139.wav|85|I've won the British.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_259.wav|6|It is not a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_209.wav|58|On that they agree.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_162.wav|93|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_118.wav|93|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_441.wav|95|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_311.wav|95|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_016.wav|42|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_246.wav|103|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_240.wav|11|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_389.wav|94|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_286.wav|55|The future might well be green after all.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_384.wav|91|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_339.wav|40|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_173.wav|39|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_263.wav|0|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_320.wav|13|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_391.wav|48|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_036.wav|58|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_190.wav|91|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_450.wav|27|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_242.wav|82|Surely it should be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_013.wav|62|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_250.wav|102|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_359.wav|99|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_289.wav|51|I'm not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_305.wav|106|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_078.wav|38|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_385.wav|107|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_263.wav|66|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_123.wav|68|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_064.wav|75|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_410.wav|65|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_115.wav|25|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_150.wav|6|I didn't really expect to be called up.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_416.wav|37|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_164.wav|2|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_237.wav|31|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_011.wav|75|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_083.wav|102|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_288.wav|99|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_145.wav|18|I certainly think it should be there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_235.wav|35|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_098.wav|104|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_380.wav|40|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_412.wav|20|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_380.wav|96|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_320.wav|67|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_180.wav|74|Are you the man from The Herald?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_285.wav|65|They have the cash and the fire power.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_298.wav|76|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_094.wav|27|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p326/p326_343.wav|28|Both are national treasures.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_283.wav|97|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_134.wav|57|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_137.wav|55|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_361.wav|31|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_258.wav|17|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_307.wav|95|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_412.wav|38|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_136.wav|34|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_371.wav|24|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_033.wav|69|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_055.wav|49|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_075.wav|2|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_172.wav|64|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_243.wav|95|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_171.wav|100|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_092.wav|88|But this has already been rejected.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_403.wav|32|We're not taking any risks.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_469.wav|95|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_276.wav|69|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_110.wav|39|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_227.wav|11|He is doing just that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_228.wav|33|I grew up with them.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_399.wav|79|This idea is a good starting point.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_276.wav|18|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_236.wav|17|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_058.wav|10|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_298.wav|70|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_048.wav|19|We were very much a happy family.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_265.wav|0|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_359.wav|50|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_109.wav|79|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_192.wav|101|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_197.wav|3|He has defended the system.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_324.wav|79|We are very proud of him.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_115.wav|62|This looks like it's anything but open.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_302.wav|83|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_287.wav|77|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_325.wav|60|For me, any manager is good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_376.wav|89|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_039.wav|5|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_037.wav|51|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_221.wav|75|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_180.wav|63|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_127.wav|104|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_288.wav|46|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_301.wav|88|Is he any good?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_097.wav|63|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_247.wav|4|I believe in theatre.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_381.wav|45|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_155.wav|43|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_211.wav|97|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_416.wav|24|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_178.wav|69|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_398.wav|28|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_392.wav|79|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_050.wav|41|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_376.wav|62|Gordon Brown was superb.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_209.wav|39|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_275.wav|99|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_387.wav|103|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_233.wav|64|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_387.wav|104|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_231.wav|95|Consumers have the right to choose.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_332.wav|100|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_172.wav|2|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_052.wav|95|I would say the position is open.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_350.wav|64|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_288.wav|73|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_229.wav|4|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_070.wav|96|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_292.wav|94|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_276.wav|44|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_323.wav|45|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_073.wav|64|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_407.wav|42|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_414.wav|37|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_325.wav|23|You've gotten all the facts.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_027.wav|104|It means we have to have some patience.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_280.wav|80|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_155.wav|95|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_049.wav|52|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_022.wav|14|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY2/p311/p311_029.wav|4|It was a matter of chance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_230.wav|54|Everything was up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_010.wav|54|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_384.wav|52|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_106.wav|0|I was always a little behind.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_327.wav|54|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_298.wav|58|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_412.wav|37|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_311.wav|78|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_233.wav|11|We are very happy with the verdict.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_070.wav|10|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_457.wav|8|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_088.wav|89|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_053.wav|79|It is an important step forward.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_275.wav|29|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_290.wav|51|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_215.wav|41|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_399.wav|64|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_061.wav|34|It is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_185.wav|31|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_139.wav|36|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_368.wav|50|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_218.wav|74|I am feeling a bit better.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_389.wav|64|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_321.wav|91|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_217.wav|67|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_257.wav|54|Israel has done very little until now.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_353.wav|42|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_264.wav|31|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_370.wav|10|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_110.wav|22|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_302.wav|17|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_235.wav|50|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_265.wav|7|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_406.wav|77|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.

DUMMY2/p244/p244_365.wav|78|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_073.wav|107|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_020.wav|1|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_039.wav|18|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_346.wav|54|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_411.wav|65|They like big name players.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_332.wav|75|These days will be back.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_069.wav|62|It is still with Ministers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_014.wav|4|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_254.wav|100|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_217.wav|17|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_082.wav|85|Most of them have already gone home.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_059.wav|30|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_172.wav|3|I have had a good life.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_382.wav|95|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_028.wav|88|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_436.wav|24|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_197.wav|91|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_386.wav|65|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_046.wav|46|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_422.wav|105|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_299.wav|36|This is the correct decision.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_075.wav|89|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_136.wav|99|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_243.wav|53|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_186.wav|57|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_250.wav|51|And what is she escaping from?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_387.wav|17|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_361.wav|68|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_160.wav|104|I am the Son of Sam.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_189.wav|47|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_263.wav|72|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_328.wav|22|He is young but not too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_291.wav|37|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_465.wav|50|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_375.wav|21|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_217.wav|91|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_238.wav|54|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_410.wav|24|Growth will come later in the cycle.

DUMMY2/p245/p245_033.wav|59|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_228.wav|73|You should be.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_184.wav|34|It would be difficult to argue with that.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_334.wav|22|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_259.wav|5|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_135.wav|72|It was a takeover.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_150.wav|84|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.

DUMMY2/p329/p329_142.wav|103|And he had much need.

DUMMY2/p292/p292_141.wav|13|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_371.wav|6|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_329.wav|48|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_161.wav|70|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_067.wav|66|And who would argue with that?

DUMMY2/p278/p278_033.wav|10|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_249.wav|22|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_348.wav|107|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_190.wav|78|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_421.wav|0|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_011.wav|95|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_068.wav|13|His record with England was not good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_073.wav|81|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_207.wav|21|He is helping police with their inquiries.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_285.wav|22|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_408.wav|54|I didn't do too badly myself.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_050.wav|29|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_037.wav|73|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_168.wav|57|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_374.wav|37|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_322.wav|51|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_006.wav|58|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_256.wav|78|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_386.wav|50|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_068.wav|9|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_451.wav|100|The funding is now there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_364.wav|35|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_161.wav|51|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_074.wav|15|She's afraid of life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_211.wav|24|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_246.wav|56|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_270.wav|7|He was good, but not that good.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_222.wav|42|There has been no reaction from them.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_244.wav|105|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_266.wav|104|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_231.wav|91|He said because people had invited him.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_302.wav|30|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_116.wav|22|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_405.wav|87|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_164.wav|28|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_285.wav|16|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_022.wav|64|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_239.wav|85|The following year, they asked him again.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_336.wav|103|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_195.wav|66|Felt good about it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_156.wav|7|So I got a blood test.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_023.wav|43|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_257.wav|10|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_235.wav|3|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_049.wav|5|The State would provide.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_196.wav|3|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_030.wav|100|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_340.wav|19|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_098.wav|22|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_261.wav|15|I can't deny that fact.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_198.wav|88|You would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_460.wav|75|The chief constable has retired.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_045.wav|57|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_379.wav|38|He said to me, Which one, son?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_202.wav|57|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_086.wav|32|This is a complex and detailed report.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_230.wav|85|We all knew it could not be true.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_276.wav|47|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_004.wav|27|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_340.wav|106|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_104.wav|11|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_055.wav|11|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_178.wav|19|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_357.wav|55|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_314.wav|86|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_438.wav|32|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_259.wav|20|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_137.wav|65|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_055.wav|27|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_172.wav|69|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_367.wav|0|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_014.wav|63|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_118.wav|88|It has been a great success.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_368.wav|72|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_173.wav|56|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p230/p230_044.wav|35|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_002.wav|36|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_081.wav|35|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_363.wav|82|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_353.wav|66|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_229.wav|12|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_239.wav|6|I'm so looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_320.wav|87|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_306.wav|76|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_372.wav|105|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_140.wav|11|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_083.wav|62|I've played them all in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_269.wav|17|I think it is totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_161.wav|61|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_357.wav|22|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_414.wav|1|It's nothing to do with me.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_069.wav|75|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_289.wav|25|It was hopeless.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_117.wav|65|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_257.wav|49|That gives us a bit of a chance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_208.wav|1|We began to walk down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_123.wav|16|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_018.wav|74|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_026.wav|34|Film music was never the same again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_341.wav|16|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_355.wav|105|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_205.wav|2|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_121.wav|45|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_084.wav|28|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_074.wav|47|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_213.wav|39|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_281.wav|81|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_305.wav|26|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_222.wav|102|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_142.wav|59|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_417.wav|98|They want to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_028.wav|22|The law has got to be upheld.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_335.wav|3|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_438.wav|36|I didn't get to keep it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_423.wav|98|Tonight is very special.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_080.wav|100|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_244.wav|23|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_133.wav|104|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_146.wav|88|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_269.wav|62|She would say he was still the best.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_392.wav|40|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_184.wav|57|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_023.wav|24|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_350.wav|100|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_258.wav|1|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_194.wav|1|No government has that right.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_312.wav|33|Either system could have prevented the crash.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_047.wav|4|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_288.wav|76|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_080.wav|91|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_168.wav|69|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_375.wav|27|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_360.wav|86|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_096.wav|68|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_122.wav|101|I didn't feel under any pressure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_350.wav|2|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_121.wav|25|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_308.wav|48|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_216.wav|3|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_095.wav|22|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_221.wav|64|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_316.wav|74|You know it was good fun.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_459.wav|36|We are going through the process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_146.wav|100|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_325.wav|15|Is that what people want?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_100.wav|45|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_090.wav|94|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_255.wav|99|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_200.wav|52|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_204.wav|1|She was right about the struggle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_089.wav|43|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_225.wav|71|"However, no further action was taken by police."
DUMMY2/p272/p272_090.wav|69|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_108.wav|61|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_279.wav|30|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_113.wav|28|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_299.wav|104|We started from scratch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_055.wav|35|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_211.wav|7|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_154.wav|44|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_277.wav|94|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_377.wav|47|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_056.wav|38|Why do it?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_317.wav|59|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_247.wav|8|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_216.wav|68|People are so negative about the whole business.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_403.wav|37|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_195.wav|24|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_330.wav|101|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_317.wav|103|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_051.wav|4|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_243.wav|42|But they didn't much like that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_355.wav|75|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_402.wav|58|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_090.wav|18|In fact, he took it very well.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_076.wav|61|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_127.wav|63|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_060.wav|54|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_117.wav|70|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_114.wav|17|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_225.wav|6|We don't come here for our health.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_184.wav|80|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_320.wav|79|I have some comments.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_166.wav|87|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_062.wav|12|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_261.wav|13|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_295.wav|64|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_148.wav|69|The role of the law lords would be retained.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_390.wav|68|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_291.wav|0|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_213.wav|6|I think it must be the uniforms.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_118.wav|65|But I am in practice.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_013.wav|48|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_228.wav|11|The night is young.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_351.wav|15|It doesn't make me feel any better.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_402.wav|98|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_092.wav|42|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_318.wav|59|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_010.wav|76|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_239.wav|18|There are two mysteries.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_111.wav|40|It is a financial matter.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_104.wav|42|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_252.wav|13|This could prove a problem.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_312.wav|101|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_166.wav|20|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_222.wav|105|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_105.wav|32|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_405.wav|20|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_152.wav|11|That's the important thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_185.wav|4|It feels that the game is off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_198.wav|106|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_120.wav|101|The industry is not well organised.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_405.wav|58|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_075.wav|67|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_374.wav|34|The answer is mayhem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_190.wav|74|I think it was just a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_152.wav|86|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_079.wav|28|I am immensely proud of them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_255.wav|17|We went on to become very successful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_275.wav|61|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_368.wav|68|It was also put on the Internet.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_166.wav|33|It feels that the game is off.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_002.wav|2|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_343.wav|89|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_275.wav|26|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_287.wav|47|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_389.wav|23|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_326.wav|51|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_084.wav|97|This has not, and has been neglected.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_297.wav|86|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_137.wav|25|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_047.wav|56|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_110.wav|84|We are currently working on the details.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_225.wav|73|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_016.wav|66|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_297.wav|19|What's the point of staying sober?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_029.wav|53|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_251.wav|40|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_072.wav|97|This is not an optional extra.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_028.wav|27|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_170.wav|99|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_116.wav|76|We act because we must.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_253.wav|44|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_265.wav|39|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_006.wav|27|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_262.wav|46|I have just got to get back.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_188.wav|15|I thought he was at fault.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_112.wav|96|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_380.wav|66|We cannot lose it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_035.wav|95|It could well be the case.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_114.wav|68|The cold war is over.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_392.wav|16|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_083.wav|88|His arrival could be the making of them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_080.wav|53|They said our costs were too high.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_205.wav|56|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_152.wav|0|That is not too bad.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_021.wav|69|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_043.wav|35|The big problem is the lack of grass.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_311.wav|54|We've got a great defensive club.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_196.wav|89|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_210.wav|56|The transaction is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_218.wav|101|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_344.wav|50|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_233.wav|0|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_253.wav|97|They just made me feel dizzy.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_002.wav|100|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_106.wav|92|This has been a terrible experience.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_003.wav|81|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_087.wav|56|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_157.wav|13|It is a new company for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_387.wav|64|There was no energy behind it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_003.wav|103|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_198.wav|94|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_028.wav|99|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_368.wav|20|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_360.wav|9|They got upset.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_081.wav|107|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_209.wav|81|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_021.wav|85|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_303.wav|83|You should be.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_352.wav|102|Who has the second highest?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_146.wav|47|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_278.wav|24|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_105.wav|4|It is easy to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_298.wav|69|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_305.wav|94|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_372.wav|7|He was at school in Devon.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_304.wav|32|There's nothing I can say.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_073.wav|86|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_199.wav|13|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_134.wav|43|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_227.wav|16|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_192.wav|31|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_263.wav|27|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_333.wav|6|I must make that clear.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_219.wav|68|It has made me feel good.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_067.wav|30|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_050.wav|53|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_206.wav|20|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_049.wav|1|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_079.wav|78|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_134.wav|45|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_332.wav|82|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_323.wav|82|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_241.wav|48|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_202.wav|98|I've been enjoying it, though.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_243.wav|4|It has changed, and not for the better.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_204.wav|8|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_224.wav|68|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_394.wav|102|The award was a lifeline for me.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_036.wav|17|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_186.wav|56|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_228.wav|31|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_237.wav|14|The scientific debate is dead.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_383.wav|18|It could now be up to the courts.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_246.wav|95|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_386.wav|63|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_340.wav|11|But we can't have a casino.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_099.wav|78|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_252.wav|46|There are a few changes.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_144.wav|80|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_239.wav|36|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_136.wav|100|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_262.wav|14|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_206.wav|30|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_233.wav|37|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_339.wav|11|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_317.wav|52|He will just go on doing his job.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_134.wav|61|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_337.wav|93|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_123.wav|66|The lady is right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_052.wav|46|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_062.wav|86|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_301.wav|81|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_397.wav|34|Of course he does!
DUMMY2/p360/p360_348.wav|60|Our position is extremely simple.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_129.wav|49|A win was a real achievement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_114.wav|26|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_261.wav|8|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_407.wav|96|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_218.wav|26|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_261.wav|28|I didn't know what he was capable of.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_076.wav|72|But, of course, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_278.wav|102|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_029.wav|14|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_366.wav|78|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_110.wav|48|I can't remember a lot of it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_210.wav|1|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_098.wav|9|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_303.wav|13|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_149.wav|70|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_006.wav|79|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_336.wav|96|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_073.wav|40|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_325.wav|35|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_276.wav|41|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_017.wav|74|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_010.wav|20|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_107.wav|41|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_093.wav|70|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_293.wav|47|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_395.wav|23|This is a completely new experience for me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_073.wav|83|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_088.wav|61|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_042.wav|68|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_249.wav|19|We should be rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_266.wav|17|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_171.wav|32|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_173.wav|86|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_205.wav|15|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_401.wav|38|And they all had these other commitments.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_269.wav|100|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_152.wav|34|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_226.wav|12|I found a fault and worked at it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_247.wav|91|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_273.wav|40|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_130.wav|14|We suffered a lot for seven years.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_349.wav|21|That had not happened on this occasion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_318.wav|1|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_090.wav|10|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_016.wav|82|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_166.wav|46|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_268.wav|36|That would depend on the parole board.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_199.wav|75|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_236.wav|2|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_286.wav|80|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_056.wav|27|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_254.wav|66|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_350.wav|67|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_292.wav|8|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_418.wav|105|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_101.wav|91|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_387.wav|26|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_360.wav|102|She looked very, very poor.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_243.wav|82|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_149.wav|69|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_216.wav|53|I am not going to judge them.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_201.wav|94|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_164.wav|93|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_257.wav|106|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_441.wav|89|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_008.wav|5|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_347.wav|16|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_157.wav|71|"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_097.wav|29|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_210.wav|28|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_318.wav|82|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_399.wav|2|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_281.wav|53|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_132.wav|16|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_250.wav|89|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_077.wav|20|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_161.wav|87|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_244.wav|47|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_026.wav|76|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_207.wav|73|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_416.wav|14|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_285.wav|2|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_304.wav|59|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_343.wav|31|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_007.wav|16|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_420.wav|76|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_391.wav|45|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_031.wav|49|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_061.wav|104|I think we'll just keep it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_138.wav|80|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_268.wav|30|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_044.wav|61|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_300.wav|57|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_209.wav|53|They are a victim of their own success.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_271.wav|20|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_167.wav|46|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_278.wav|45|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_403.wav|70|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_344.wav|93|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_283.wav|102|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_071.wav|76|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_390.wav|72|Changes need to be made.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_071.wav|86|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_112.wav|13|They were back in favour with the SAC.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_495.wav|75|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_032.wav|30|He's not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_007.wav|37|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_151.wav|65|Does that put pressure on us?)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_020.wav|101|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_019.wav|101|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_350.wav|19|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_107.wav|11|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_128.wav|9|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_235.wav|49|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_045.wav|34|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_362.wav|40|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_012.wav|41|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_087.wav|70|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_413.wav|100|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_136.wav|6|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_092.wav|100|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_189.wav|39|The region is open for business.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_082.wav|90|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_181.wav|36|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_230.wav|92|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_388.wav|70|I'm glad I came.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_111.wav|23|Look at his last couple of records.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_211.wav|96|Feel the heat ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_137.wav|49|I am prepared to help make it happen.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_252.wav|64|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_127.wav|56|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_314.wav|65|Hibs are playing with style now.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_075.wav|69|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_229.wav|11|That is bad enough.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_071.wav|78|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_364.wav|57|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_415.wav|75|I've got my own ideas.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_087.wav|14|I've had it for the exams.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_390.wav|69|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_203.wav|44|You can be sure we will have problems.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_192.wav|91|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_117.wav|84|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_002.wav|81|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_136.wav|102|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_081.wav|58|You can't keep them separate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_148.wav|2|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_271.wav|93|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_248.wav|82|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_140.wav|18|My ambition is to make the cut.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_058.wav|104|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_351.wav|24|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_039.wav|25|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_239.wav|94|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_254.wav|54|I still feel like a wee boy.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_343.wav|66|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_206.wav|72|Their moment had come, or so they said.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_193.wav|102|You look at them and you understand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_102.wav|104|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_043.wav|14|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_149.wav|66|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_344.wav|91|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_374.wav|49|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_452.wav|106|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_002.wav|37|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_089.wav|82|I believe that so strongly.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_251.wav|50|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_038.wav|34|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_131.wav|25|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_024.wav|67|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_091.wav|85|There was no bad behaviour.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_208.wav|72|Some examples are presented in detail.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_159.wav|3|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_351.wav|87|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_128.wav|81|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_377.wav|7|An alternative must be offered.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_188.wav|60|Only one person can claim the credit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_295.wav|56|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_335.wav|69|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_313.wav|92|I think they are right to be impatient.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_117.wav|20|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_215.wav|68|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_198.wav|47|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_355.wav|84|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_296.wav|49|I'd never be free.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_293.wav|48|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_352.wav|72|There is room for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_136.wav|107|Do you think they would do any better?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_194.wav|17|I just had so much fun.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_277.wav|13|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_263.wav|44|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_081.wav|20|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_278.wav|73|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_185.wav|12|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_389.wav|76|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_018.wav|67|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_157.wav|29|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_030.wav|57|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_066.wav|70|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_374.wav|96|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_394.wav|68|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_212.wav|28|His style is suited to Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_161.wav|31|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_154.wav|14|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_258.wav|79|He will appear in court today.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_081.wav|97|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_018.wav|46|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_403.wav|72|Just get on with your job.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_064.wav|33|The devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_393.wav|27|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_386.wav|60|They are with their father.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_203.wav|42|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_067.wav|44|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_319.wav|64|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_352.wav|4|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_202.wav|7|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_014.wav|53|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_116.wav|42|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_077.wav|53|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_027.wav|7|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_161.wav|34|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_261.wav|98|All the children on the roll are genuine.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_212.wav|25|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_136.wav|71|"Nobody in the world can get away from him."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_092.wav|65|However this weekend it will be different.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_038.wav|36|It is a financial matter.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_325.wav|103|Pressure of work is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_077.wav|1|The problem is Labour.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_344.wav|94|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_199.wav|89|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_070.wav|34|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_275.wav|6|Now we have had enough.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_018.wav|7|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_118.wav|26|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_332.wav|107|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_318.wav|92|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_086.wav|18|It will probably be my last, too.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_162.wav|104|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_463.wav|95|This morning I got a call from my wife.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_196.wav|67|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_068.wav|51|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_014.wav|16|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_316.wav|3|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_092.wav|101|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_159.wav|107|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_245.wav|29|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_033.wav|40|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_264.wav|24|He is a reporter for us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_308.wav|31|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_313.wav|61|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_048.wav|46|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_254.wav|67|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_070.wav|49|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_371.wav|78|I have a good feeling about this.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_357.wav|97|The other was the tabloids.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_344.wav|18|They have to be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_065.wav|77|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_349.wav|8|Nobody said it was required.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_146.wav|29|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_308.wav|68|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_184.wav|68|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_315.wav|100|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_212.wav|94|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_106.wav|66|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_333.wav|39|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_139.wav|50|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_319.wav|103|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_140.wav|21|That was a good effort.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_159.wav|53|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_120.wav|104|My father and mother are.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_408.wav|107|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_184.wav|13|We didn't think anything would happen.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_376.wav|92|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_199.wav|7|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_376.wav|56|It was like a weekly wage.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_190.wav|56|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_106.wav|103|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_231.wav|106|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_169.wav|88|I hope that doesn't happen.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_001.wav|26|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_335.wav|9|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_240.wav|98|There is no other way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_323.wav|29|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_140.wav|83|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_284.wav|77|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_142.wav|50|It only increased the support for him.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_074.wav|55|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_143.wav|104|It's hard not to.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_036.wav|51|But she was very human.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_076.wav|24|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_363.wav|78|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_305.wav|62|It is good to look back.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_031.wav|99|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_127.wav|25|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_329.wav|95|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_257.wav|2|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_105.wav|92|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_150.wav|59|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_292.wav|75|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_211.wav|60|We should have no more problems.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_198.wav|8|I know every village and island on the west coast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_331.wav|26|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_270.wav|62|He finished the night in a cell.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_249.wav|86|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_290.wav|26|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_442.wav|8|It deserved to be a winner.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_424.wav|78|But it was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_057.wav|29|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_091.wav|12|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_151.wav|100|But I am still awaiting an answer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_376.wav|103|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_392.wav|94|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_493.wav|48|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_275.wav|36|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_059.wav|69|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_161.wav|98|I have no battle with the Scots.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_028.wav|87|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_231.wav|39|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_243.wav|87|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_049.wav|0|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_392.wav|2|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_139.wav|11|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_427.wav|63|No date has been fixed for his return.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_283.wav|40|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_395.wav|56|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_364.wav|18|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_041.wav|61|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_080.wav|43|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_028.wav|36|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_316.wav|13|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_219.wav|102|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_004.wav|70|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_209.wav|93|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_311.wav|65|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_088.wav|78|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_080.wav|63|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_271.wav|30|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_034.wav|68|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_007.wav|35|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_453.wav|89|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_241.wav|27|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_229.wav|55|Three hit the target.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_369.wav|34|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_194.wav|67|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_151.wav|66|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_079.wav|2|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p276/p276_064.wav|106|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_370.wav|4|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_052.wav|3|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_313.wav|46|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_182.wav|73|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_198.wav|56|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_298.wav|38|People are fed up.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_044.wav|57|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_270.wav|81|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_344.wav|13|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_130.wav|83|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_277.wav|75|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_097.wav|25|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_289.wav|52|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_159.wav|11|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_305.wav|19|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_220.wav|69|They must do it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_434.wav|75|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_194.wav|60|But it won't make a difference.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_367.wav|89|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_305.wav|27|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_227.wav|31|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_024.wav|73|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_265.wav|33|There he goes again.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_243.wav|26|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_076.wav|30|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_017.wav|19|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_096.wav|102|He told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_372.wav|25|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_377.wav|37|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_165.wav|10|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_017.wav|12|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_247.wav|99|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_189.wav|49|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_124.wav|49|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p272/p272_137.wav|69|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_375.wav|85|It is a flexible concept.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_345.wav|35|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_131.wav|7|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_244.wav|46|He's in with the furniture.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_081.wav|46|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_208.wav|49|We don't say there was a massacre.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_391.wav|56|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_253.wav|80|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_087.wav|40|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_298.wav|62|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_128.wav|87|Their season has been consigned to history.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_322.wav|104|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_362.wav|37|It was a good workout.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_182.wav|86|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_346.wav|53|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_057.wav|48|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_162.wav|88|I don't know where it went.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_127.wav|14|I can't even get into the A team.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_249.wav|30|It means they actually control the programme.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_039.wav|77|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_485.wav|24|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_164.wav|54|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_211.wav|58|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_005.wav|12|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_050.wav|10|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_094.wav|7|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_025.wav|97|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_242.wav|27|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_159.wav|65|Sport is good for you.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_080.wav|96|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_094.wav|58|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_447.wav|36|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_090.wav|26|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_177.wav|89|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_165.wav|63|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_071.wav|45|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_202.wav|86|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_184.wav|45|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_166.wav|14|It has become a way of life.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_396.wav|106|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_262.wav|33|I certainly hope not.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_084.wav|89|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_195.wav|106|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_198.wav|85|There must be boundaries.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_019.wav|65|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_045.wav|25|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_085.wav|98|I don't think it is.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_130.wav|50|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_356.wav|106|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_052.wav|68|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_387.wav|87|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_025.wav|107|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_119.wav|56|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_150.wav|78|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_054.wav|32|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_260.wav|73|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_422.wav|77|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_362.wav|6|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_248.wav|13|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_015.wav|7|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p243/p243_108.wav|53|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_309.wav|83|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_419.wav|60|I don't think they are too serious.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_275.wav|93|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_275.wav|3|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_362.wav|105|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_291.wav|6|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_027.wav|41|They may be wrong.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_153.wav|5|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_112.wav|30|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_099.wav|68|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_412.wav|100|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_323.wav|32|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_192.wav|2|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_097.wav|81|I am extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_389.wav|65|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_490.wav|48|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_388.wav|74|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_154.wav|84|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_251.wav|37|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_017.wav|88|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_065.wav|69|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_330.wav|20|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_194.wav|53|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_191.wav|31|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_199.wav|93|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_067.wav|27|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_386.wav|41|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_135.wav|14|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_331.wav|66|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_399.wav|41|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_031.wav|35|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_028.wav|98|This is a very interesting move.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_317.wav|81|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_169.wav|43|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_421.wav|36|Footballers have also been targeted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_158.wav|81|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_306.wav|47|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p351/p351_418.wav|33|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_160.wav|5|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_153.wav|49|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_089.wav|99|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_102.wav|49|This would not be my first choice.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_289.wav|85|He knows what he's got to do.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_133.wav|35|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_305.wav|9|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_245.wav|76|The truth is otherwise.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_163.wav|22|This is a United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_084.wav|65|Maybe they will see sense.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_247.wav|58|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_024.wav|43|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_055.wav|96|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_086.wav|98|There are no other contenders.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_306.wav|49|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_284.wav|103|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_003.wav|43|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_207.wav|19|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_214.wav|36|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_131.wav|75|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_034.wav|58|This is a totally different order of agreement.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_293.wav|5|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_052.wav|44|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_079.wav|95|It is very special for me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_142.wav|34|They would love to do more films.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_042.wav|60|I have no intention of resigning today.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_129.wav|98|Everyone in front of me was dead.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_180.wav|21|The talking cannot go on too long.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_342.wav|102|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_036.wav|64|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_085.wav|12|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_336.wav|49|We will be stronger in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_353.wav|13|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_318.wav|48|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_292.wav|89|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_231.wav|26|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_102.wav|22|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_215.wav|28|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_379.wav|91|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_134.wav|88|I love a clever reader.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_074.wav|53|But two groups refused to sign up.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_067.wav|55|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_359.wav|32|We have very limited capacity.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_082.wav|104|It was like a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_243.wav|56|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_297.wav|24|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_051.wav|40|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_206.wav|0|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_302.wav|67|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_145.wav|102|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_371.wav|11|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_359.wav|2|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_133.wav|17|We don't see it as downgrading.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_307.wav|103|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_142.wav|98|This is the man who provides the hope.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_295.wav|80|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_229.wav|72|But he insisted that victory was possible.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_134.wav|93|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_137.wav|53|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_262.wav|51|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_196.wav|7|It shows the strength of the roots.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_042.wav|28|We just love to chat.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_312.wav|64|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_183.wav|87|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_335.wav|67|He told the court.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_021.wav|68|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_294.wav|17|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_153.wav|74|It really is tremendous.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_175.wav|11|It is the manager's decision.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_153.wav|2|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_276.wav|52|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_328.wav|11|This could be a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_099.wav|74|We deserved to win it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_129.wav|86|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_393.wav|17|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_190.wav|106|As if that is an achievement.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_325.wav|4|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_095.wav|56|We intend to change the model.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_036.wav|0|A week is a long time in politics.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_059.wav|1|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_154.wav|54|Health care workers and labourers followed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_151.wav|74|Annika is very, very fit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_185.wav|1|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_405.wav|54|The surprise is its product is so poor.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_415.wav|48|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_143.wav|66|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_143.wav|99|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_266.wav|84|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_393.wav|24|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_207.wav|56|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_151.wav|106|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_142.wav|26|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_249.wav|8|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_016.wav|77|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_189.wav|62|There is a lot of heroin about.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_034.wav|23|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_170.wav|70|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_177.wav|64|I never found my rhythm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_206.wav|21|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_319.wav|5|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_339.wav|80|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_187.wav|39|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_412.wav|76|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_023.wav|46|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_054.wav|84|We are working on it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_057.wav|60|It was very full anyway.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_380.wav|62|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_025.wav|19|They will be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_285.wav|100|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_049.wav|32|We are certainly talking about many millions.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_321.wav|74|Structural changes will never be enough.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_234.wav|88|It was all over for us then.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_192.wav|87|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_023.wav|19|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_249.wav|42|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_204.wav|68|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_354.wav|106|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_118.wav|63|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_083.wav|29|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_135.wav|33|My whole family is.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_347.wav|22|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_189.wav|40|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_283.wav|18|There is nothing to be gained from that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_168.wav|66|Look at his last couple of records.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_413.wav|74|The power of religion is so strong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_219.wav|62|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_387.wav|6|A decision is expected today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_437.wav|95|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_204.wav|59|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_040.wav|40|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_232.wav|17|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_236.wav|16|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_306.wav|17|This is not a faceless system.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_334.wav|102|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_082.wav|19|This does not help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_063.wav|105|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_409.wav|107|I have no argument with Scotland.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_013.wav|84|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_076.wav|85|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_267.wav|96|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_358.wav|8|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_273.wav|39|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_072.wav|22|Michael is putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_388.wav|103|They did not interfere.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_120.wav|96|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_227.wav|45|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_128.wav|80|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_072.wav|47|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_035.wav|82|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_211.wav|53|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_307.wav|54|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_307.wav|66|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_458.wav|89|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_063.wav|93|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_024.wav|58|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_266.wav|25|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_424.wav|75|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_188.wav|31|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_251.wav|91|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_288.wav|85|We are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_416.wav|85|He was all blackened.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_199.wav|49|There we were on the first tee.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_100.wav|10|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_229.wav|28|We are going to go about our lives.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_230.wav|89|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_190.wav|11|It's a matter of time.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_246.wav|72|He can perform well under pressure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_014.wav|74|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_280.wav|5|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_229.wav|13|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_102.wav|54|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_249.wav|73|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_341.wav|23|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_125.wav|51|But it will backfire.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_369.wav|103|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_385.wav|78|Everything is in the mix.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_066.wav|49|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_255.wav|30|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_218.wav|35|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_034.wav|75|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_215.wav|37|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_109.wav|58|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_346.wav|79|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_206.wav|81|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_365.wav|55|Analysts welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_341.wav|76|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_094.wav|42|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_416.wav|104|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_275.wav|74|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_395.wav|4|Nobody can take it away from me.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_144.wav|15|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_109.wav|54|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_125.wav|12|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_201.wav|104|All options are on the table.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_397.wav|105|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_274.wav|44|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_249.wav|28|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_305.wav|44|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_176.wav|82|Directing, if you like.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_254.wav|73|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_269.wav|99|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_240.wav|101|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_363.wav|23|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_154.wav|40|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_362.wav|14|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_132.wav|68|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_020.wav|6|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_225.wav|90|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_141.wav|33|We will be victorious.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_060.wav|78|We have got to deliver.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_412.wav|51|It is a natural reaction.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_097.wav|71|"But it was a pleasure."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_201.wav|31|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_279.wav|81|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_131.wav|96|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_143.wav|51|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_167.wav|94|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_440.wav|65|That approach has passed its sell by date.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_151.wav|0|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_366.wav|58|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_004.wav|78|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_289.wav|39|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_100.wav|78|This is a game of confidence.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_384.wav|18|We can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_044.wav|96|We will push.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_005.wav|52|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_143.wav|13|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_476.wav|48|Banking stocks were hit hard.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_143.wav|53|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_309.wav|54|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_005.wav|42|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_115.wav|86|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_345.wav|3|However, the devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_139.wav|0|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_001.wav|67|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_085.wav|29|The latter is due to be finished in February.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_268.wav|104|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_098.wav|4|He's got me very well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_078.wav|69|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_462.wav|100|They were totally behind it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_418.wav|79|It is a result we should savour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_072.wav|40|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_342.wav|32|That's the way it goes.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_114.wav|51|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_128.wav|88|This time, it was not be.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_001.wav|93|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_065.wav|44|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_022.wav|80|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_140.wav|79|Only one was from Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_213.wav|93|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_334.wav|50|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_102.wav|83|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_035.wav|19|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_326.wav|73|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_386.wav|19|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_454.wav|8|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_228.wav|69|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_265.wav|30|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_358.wav|36|I said she was very young.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_358.wav|49|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_108.wav|66|I was a bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_114.wav|48|It is sometimes like that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_264.wav|97|It will be an eye for an eye.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_199.wav|98|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_112.wav|50|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_237.wav|4|This was an option from the beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_409.wav|17|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_069.wav|36|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_160.wav|61|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_078.wav|60|The question was simple enough.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_062.wav|92|If you're going to do it, do it right.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_072.wav|42|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_425.wav|100|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_210.wav|11|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_215.wav|45|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_252.wav|49|I think he was surprised.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_172.wav|65|I'm taking each day as it comes.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_282.wav|47|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_089.wav|16|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_205.wav|66|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_003.wav|106|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_319.wav|79|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_044.wav|27|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_031.wav|8|Drugs are a serious problem.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_236.wav|13|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_384.wav|97|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_181.wav|4|That will help my case a bit.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_229.wav|84|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_409.wav|87|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_175.wav|100|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_335.wav|78|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_043.wav|54|He stands on Centre Court alone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_256.wav|89|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_372.wav|45|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_335.wav|29|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_205.wav|57|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_327.wav|44|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_154.wav|78|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_130.wav|104|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_449.wav|48|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_195.wav|21|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_297.wav|77|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_190.wav|31|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_371.wav|95|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_042.wav|41|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_103.wav|85|We had to push to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_238.wav|100|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_216.wav|56|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_184.wav|96|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_044.wav|94|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_387.wav|0|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_489.wav|75|Something has got to change.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_291.wav|16|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_294.wav|96|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_304.wav|7|They can leave at any time.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_323.wav|8|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_043.wav|5|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_217.wav|3|Being investor ready is a good start.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_094.wav|95|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_216.wav|25|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_129.wav|7|Tiger is not the norm.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_192.wav|25|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_283.wav|38|Does it, Noel?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_431.wav|50|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_062.wav|95|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_255.wav|82|I don't think he was being very fair.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_051.wav|106|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_368.wav|19|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_019.wav|63|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_418.wav|38|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_004.wav|79|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_418.wav|54|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_058.wav|9|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_234.wav|4|Where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_364.wav|21|There's a hint of classical.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_215.wav|71|"That has been the easy part."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_413.wav|32|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_322.wav|41|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_008.wav|81|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_324.wav|7|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_236.wav|74|Her heart was not in it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_381.wav|16|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_284.wav|13|He has changed my life forever.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_005.wav|53|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_047.wav|67|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_359.wav|55|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_334.wav|19|She has nothing to say to journalists.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_226.wav|77|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_048.wav|16|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_164.wav|74|My brother is not like that.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_284.wav|92|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_146.wav|60|Who was being affected?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_403.wav|55|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_117.wav|25|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_216.wav|59|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_265.wav|93|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_312.wav|8|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_123.wav|71|"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince."
DUMMY2/p252/p252_101.wav|55|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_104.wav|84|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_240.wav|50|It is now the big brother.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_140.wav|66|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_182.wav|81|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_215.wav|5|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_054.wav|50|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_070.wav|36|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_189.wav|6|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_225.wav|82|I can't get away from it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_174.wav|59|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_075.wav|38|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_394.wav|2|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_056.wav|60|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_418.wav|49|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_382.wav|0|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_001.wav|58|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_153.wav|64|I will certainly be having words with him.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_179.wav|92|There's nothing new in that argument.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_063.wav|88|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_137.wav|107|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_230.wav|79|Eight others are also believed to have died.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_239.wav|16|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_332.wav|27|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_397.wav|18|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_287.wav|8|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_307.wav|13|By now he was very ill with cancer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_168.wav|95|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_269.wav|2|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_018.wav|44|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_276.wav|79|That is one point of view.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_033.wav|18|It really has not been their season.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_180.wav|80|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_096.wav|94|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_101.wav|52|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_317.wav|42|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_191.wav|3|It is not in the public interest.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_043.wav|36|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_026.wav|61|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_305.wav|60|I'm really proud of her.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_033.wav|73|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_039.wav|56|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_232.wav|77|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_071.wav|46|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_079.wav|72|Could it be?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_396.wav|65|It has been only average.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_403.wav|15|It's going to be great!
DUMMY2/p226/p226_064.wav|43|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_148.wav|87|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_383.wav|17|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_214.wav|51|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_253.wav|64|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_098.wav|89|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_048.wav|29|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_296.wav|31|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_304.wav|40|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_106.wav|28|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_363.wav|17|I love the moment of being first.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_353.wav|2|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_069.wav|78|It was an outstanding performance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_121.wav|78|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_280.wav|30|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_100.wav|3|It should be a condition of employment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_035.wav|67|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_113.wav|2|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_418.wav|8|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_397.wav|8|It has happened for generations.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_348.wav|84|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_326.wav|34|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_222.wav|104|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_171.wav|3|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_109.wav|25|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_038.wav|31|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_392.wav|77|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_226.wav|63|Scotland will play its part.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_367.wav|66|The surprise is its product is so poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_005.wav|100|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_156.wav|32|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_011.wav|84|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_370.wav|94|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_328.wav|86|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_006.wav|97|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_219.wav|72|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_445.wav|65|It was an outstanding performance.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_399.wav|50|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_116.wav|91|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_219.wav|77|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_196.wav|52|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_319.wav|11|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_162.wav|0|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_135.wav|26|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_197.wav|88|The hearing continues today.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_222.wav|8|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_403.wav|19|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_216.wav|44|People are so negative about the whole business.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_076.wav|52|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_133.wav|82|I don't know where that one came from.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_185.wav|45|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_118.wav|96|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_001.wav|53|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_342.wav|68|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_115.wav|106|He was unprepared for this fight.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_313.wav|2|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_205.wav|75|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_104.wav|43|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_387.wav|4|My players are precious to me.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_195.wav|13|We had to work hard for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_408.wav|70|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_197.wav|85|It is not just the agencies.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_104.wav|63|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_186.wav|89|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_264.wav|96|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_301.wav|49|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_258.wav|28|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_338.wav|4|Was it just negligent.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_180.wav|0|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_339.wav|6|I am feeling on top of the world.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_311.wav|96|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_111.wav|33|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_324.wav|64|I haven't won the world title.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_022.wav|100|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_329.wav|6|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_346.wav|63|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_351.wav|101|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_148.wav|26|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_260.wav|92|But it was the sensible thing to do.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_228.wav|50|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_047.wav|70|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_037.wav|70|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_346.wav|36|It was almost too much.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_279.wav|4|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_196.wav|94|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_078.wav|40|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_108.wav|39|Our preference is to play in midweek.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_190.wav|50|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_336.wav|8|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_201.wav|1|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_207.wav|26|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_226.wav|95|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_057.wav|58|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_393.wav|45|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_240.wav|10|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_354.wav|80|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_025.wav|57|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_089.wav|38|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_253.wav|20|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_035.wav|32|This represents a tough game for us.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_355.wav|93|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_307.wav|70|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_096.wav|17|Now he will have to start again.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_177.wav|12|It shows that we are a civilised society.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_168.wav|83|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_288.wav|57|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_126.wav|58|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_314.wav|26|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_263.wav|11|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_130.wav|63|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_034.wav|59|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_288.wav|106|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_008.wav|41|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_025.wav|75|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_039.wav|15|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_409.wav|96|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_243.wav|2|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_381.wav|52|This is not a small amount of money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_179.wav|73|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_294.wav|75|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_077.wav|47|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_300.wav|106|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_373.wav|2|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_068.wav|52|But it was not all bad news.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_257.wav|43|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_146.wav|14|This represents a tough game for us.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_385.wav|104|However, many questions remained unanswered.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_345.wav|68|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_087.wav|29|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_160.wav|3|There is no common ground.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_012.wav|10|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_250.wav|20|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_330.wav|33|They're just a nonsense.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_221.wav|92|This is the best moment of my career.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_050.wav|22|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_185.wav|94|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_387.wav|36|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_382.wav|70|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_341.wav|52|Put another way, they just won't do it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_085.wav|73|This one did.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_056.wav|4|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_020.wav|66|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_158.wav|85|The things writers and directors say!
DUMMY2/p317/p317_321.wav|97|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_081.wav|23|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_161.wav|100|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_166.wav|61|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_128.wav|24|That's not an assumption that I had made.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_439.wav|89|It won the match.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_230.wav|56|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_085.wav|41|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_137.wav|43|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_316.wav|18|It was an insult.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_010.wav|37|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_118.wav|66|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_378.wav|82|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_293.wav|71|"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients."
DUMMY2/p299/p299_360.wav|58|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_211.wav|73|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_298.wav|4|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_192.wav|3|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_367.wav|17|But it's got to be worth it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_177.wav|29|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_373.wav|52|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_123.wav|61|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_211.wav|79|It is his script.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_336.wav|59|Action is needed now.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_054.wav|71|"But the law is very clear on this."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_395.wav|7|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_118.wav|20|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_118.wav|33|There's nothing new in that argument.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_082.wav|55|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_195.wav|98|Safety is our first concern.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_461.wav|14|It's because they can't understand the language.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_321.wav|58|It is a question of balance.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_419.wav|34|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_091.wav|36|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_321.wav|95|This is the correct decision.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_061.wav|51|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_223.wav|39|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_314.wav|59|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_130.wav|107|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_252.wav|43|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_196.wav|8|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_333.wav|24|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_048.wav|59|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_300.wav|7|The stage was set for a showdown.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_372.wav|95|Ferguson is a good example.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_239.wav|90|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_098.wav|48|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_360.wav|75|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_228.wav|25|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_393.wav|63|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_124.wav|76|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_205.wav|97|Pressure of work is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_031.wav|80|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_240.wav|78|This is a fight to the death.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_364.wav|19|I am amazed at what he's done.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_015.wav|60|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_122.wav|59|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_061.wav|25|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_106.wav|54|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_060.wav|91|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_393.wav|15|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_016.wav|41|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_116.wav|71|"She has been shot."
DUMMY2/p260/p260_341.wav|81|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_348.wav|83|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_310.wav|53|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_033.wav|67|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_029.wav|29|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_314.wav|87|It was a lovely sunset.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_332.wav|29|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_324.wav|72|We are all ecstatic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_386.wav|66|That gave us some confidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_382.wav|84|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_358.wav|20|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_064.wav|51|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_031.wav|32|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_272.wav|106|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_344.wav|63|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_232.wav|74|Later, a very different story emerged.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_152.wav|59|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_065.wav|5|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_147.wav|24|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_142.wav|73|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_224.wav|99|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_290.wav|16|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_025.wav|36|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_174.wav|78|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_070.wav|14|It's not covered by the insurance.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_025.wav|91|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_169.wav|107|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_210.wav|48|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_221.wav|107|They make it look very easy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_245.wav|27|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_117.wav|69|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_200.wav|73|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_190.wav|68|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_323.wav|11|It really is good to be back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_021.wav|11|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_360.wav|3|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_376.wav|67|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_168.wav|51|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_135.wav|74|He said something in his work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_248.wav|97|This is a huge event.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_120.wav|62|We are satisfied that this is the case.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_302.wav|103|I'm feeling very pleased.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_128.wav|18|But it was not just the land.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_017.wav|41|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_090.wav|71|"I love the Dome."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_385.wav|66|And that's the question for the Chamber.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_219.wav|51|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_063.wav|41|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_192.wav|92|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_071.wav|104|It took about five or six hours.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_127.wav|84|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_059.wav|79|I want to deal with this stuff.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_221.wav|88|I had no choice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_327.wav|50|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_339.wav|87|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_360.wav|53|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_102.wav|69|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_140.wav|106|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_266.wav|47|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_476.wav|50|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_216.wav|38|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_126.wav|14|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_392.wav|63|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_143.wav|43|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_078.wav|14|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_005.wav|72|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_183.wav|106|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_191.wav|19|We have understood the problems for some time.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_043.wav|91|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_058.wav|16|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_281.wav|39|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_162.wav|49|We've got the top three.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_226.wav|24|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_251.wav|59|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_198.wav|84|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_170.wav|59|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_219.wav|57|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_244.wav|54|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_192.wav|86|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_035.wav|101|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_200.wav|9|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_056.wav|85|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_335.wav|75|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_378.wav|65|John gave up everything to be with me.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_263.wav|23|It feels like a privilege.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_477.wav|65|The child has denied murder.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_088.wav|81|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_394.wav|32|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_019.wav|87|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_197.wav|81|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_334.wav|81|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_396.wav|21|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_199.wav|73|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_128.wav|10|I didn't feel under any pressure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_262.wav|8|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_039.wav|29|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_318.wav|2|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_312.wav|46|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_299.wav|69|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_148.wav|105|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_300.wav|35|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_176.wav|58|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_132.wav|40|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_002.wav|40|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_166.wav|2|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_197.wav|102|We have only nine months to go.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_186.wav|17|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_206.wav|37|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_156.wav|61|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_392.wav|58|It was a sell-out.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_321.wav|0|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_120.wav|80|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_134.wav|100|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_075.wav|41|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_030.wav|89|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_245.wav|47|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_137.wav|22|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_421.wav|8|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_364.wav|53|Both players gave so much to the side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_328.wav|18|Words are not enough.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_089.wav|105|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_427.wav|27|I'm very grateful.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_370.wav|64|Both managements are very supportive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_294.wav|58|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_088.wav|63|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_221.wav|96|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_265.wav|67|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_146.wav|21|I told that to the police.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_179.wav|48|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_189.wav|54|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_037.wav|93|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_335.wav|35|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_167.wav|7|The woman was his wife.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_059.wav|89|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_334.wav|100|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_307.wav|41|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_396.wav|87|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_188.wav|11|We have not given up.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_252.wav|55|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_195.wav|8|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_058.wav|67|What was the main difference ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_406.wav|19|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_191.wav|88|The principle is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_338.wav|24|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_063.wav|0|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_221.wav|38|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_050.wav|34|We have been let down by these people.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_054.wav|26|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_172.wav|13|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_456.wav|39|They offer a kind of narrative.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_191.wav|40|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_295.wav|48|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_269.wav|75|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_222.wav|51|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_320.wav|31|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_188.wav|32|The interim dividend has been passed.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_280.wav|26|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_007.wav|79|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_207.wav|48|We are now working with full-time on future product.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_237.wav|58|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_095.wav|7|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_012.wav|79|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_221.wav|99|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_239.wav|53|Jim was down there with his wife.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_086.wav|99|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_243.wav|17|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_361.wav|74|They really want to do it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_206.wav|22|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_384.wav|11|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_282.wav|2|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_095.wav|30|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_342.wav|19|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_344.wav|60|They have brought in the replacement.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_336.wav|65|This fact is supported by audience research.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_021.wav|17|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_051.wav|36|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_083.wav|15|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_026.wav|62|This was a rationing decision.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_255.wav|19|Our people are paying high prices.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_343.wav|22|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_052.wav|34|Nor does he have any desire to be.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_182.wav|95|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_227.wav|67|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_087.wav|37|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_097.wav|7|Ferguson must take the blame.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_341.wav|25|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_327.wav|29|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_251.wav|61|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_306.wav|37|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_365.wav|96|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_008.wav|0|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_322.wav|78|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_292.wav|3|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_099.wav|53|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_249.wav|27|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_296.wav|5|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_186.wav|14|It is vital to clarify their role.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_298.wav|18|I have no worry about that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_267.wav|69|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_058.wav|26|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_181.wav|84|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_171.wav|18|Just think about the lines.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_396.wav|1|Then  all was revealed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_091.wav|38|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_387.wav|56|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_276.wav|86|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_415.wav|98|The auction has seven days to run.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_214.wav|2|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_134.wav|42|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_138.wav|43|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_303.wav|54|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_046.wav|78|It is all about the story.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_219.wav|50|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_186.wav|40|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_156.wav|18|This news is really depressing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_052.wav|25|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_065.wav|75|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_182.wav|101|We are just glad to be alive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_037.wav|78|History is in the making.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_171.wav|67|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_245.wav|94|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_347.wav|28|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_094.wav|59|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_130.wav|29|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_016.wav|67|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_133.wav|87|Monty is great in his own backyard.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_270.wav|6|However, that is not in itself enough.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_325.wav|67|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_017.wav|3|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_170.wav|30|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_302.wav|72|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_337.wav|25|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_136.wav|73|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_335.wav|0|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_027.wav|10|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_227.wav|99|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_167.wav|10|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_029.wav|65|The local primary is excellent.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_231.wav|49|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_299.wav|64|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_349.wav|47|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_033.wav|84|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_198.wav|73|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_049.wav|50|There's nothing we could do about this.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_269.wav|63|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_291.wav|82|I don't think we could have expected better.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_175.wav|70|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_066.wav|4|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_032.wav|58|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_237.wav|24|The transaction is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_371.wav|10|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_042.wav|22|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_228.wav|77|We have learned a tremendous amount.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_021.wav|30|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_211.wav|49|The island will never recover.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_257.wav|0|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_151.wav|99|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_231.wav|69|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_296.wav|106|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_151.wav|90|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_250.wav|40|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_092.wav|16|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_409.wav|97|They have enough intrusion at the time.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_015.wav|70|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_102.wav|60|They had been forced to walk.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_301.wav|90|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_260.wav|7|It will now be revived.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_088.wav|18|We spoke about a few people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_395.wav|76|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_371.wav|63|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_317.wav|8|The pound has also suffered.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_052.wav|21|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_324.wav|99|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_316.wav|106|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_072.wav|0|A government is a government is a government.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_322.wav|56|But it is a slow process.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_098.wav|31|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_337.wav|41|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_203.wav|61|Is that success ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_100.wav|89|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_102.wav|99|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_309.wav|40|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_126.wav|102|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_257.wav|16|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_236.wav|18|I'll take it as it comes.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_279.wav|93|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_365.wav|37|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_259.wav|12|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_276.wav|74|They might be surprised by the response.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_085.wav|25|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_196.wav|77|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_241.wav|17|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_217.wav|82|It's a human tragedy.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_398.wav|95|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_034.wav|44|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_223.wav|69|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_226.wav|96|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_306.wav|26|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_220.wav|73|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_339.wav|84|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_354.wav|53|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_200.wav|98|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_050.wav|74|But it was no problem.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_027.wav|97|Yet it is all for two good causes.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_006.wav|74|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_118.wav|71|"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_350.wav|18|I thought their commitment was superb.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_095.wav|47|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_224.wav|35|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_362.wav|28|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_421.wav|103|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_053.wav|61|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_308.wav|7|Blair also had a penalty.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_219.wav|38|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_183.wav|35|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_185.wav|60|It's their moment of choice.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_377.wav|68|I have learned a lot from him.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_089.wav|83|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_388.wav|78|I would be interested in another attempt.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_148.wav|13|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_157.wav|8|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_069.wav|27|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_280.wav|73|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_092.wav|12|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_263.wav|52|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_022.wav|92|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_159.wav|21|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_198.wav|34|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_232.wav|107|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_093.wav|60|That's what makes it interesting.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_065.wav|65|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_346.wav|60|We are working so hard.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_128.wav|85|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_329.wav|3|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_383.wav|72|I think we're going to make it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_014.wav|48|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_313.wav|93|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_385.wav|69|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_244.wav|12|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_143.wav|11|I told the players that at half-time.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_087.wav|2|We knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_291.wav|102|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_197.wav|55|Now he is back on top again.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_349.wav|42|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_172.wav|18|It all depends on the wind.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_168.wav|82|But it won't be the same.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_394.wav|62|We are keen to have him back.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_039.wav|53|She will get through it I'm sure.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_177.wav|69|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_084.wav|25|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_373.wav|70|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_037.wav|61|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_281.wav|47|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_095.wav|107|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_158.wav|75|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_042.wav|72|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_328.wav|55|We were caught out.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_392.wav|76|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_007.wav|103|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_055.wav|47|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_135.wav|68|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_319.wav|65|Not one person spoke badly.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_260.wav|43|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_233.wav|32|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_138.wav|20|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_228.wav|55|The global market was about flat.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_375.wav|91|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_345.wav|98|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_002.wav|9|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_113.wav|17|But there is another side.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_405.wav|92|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_039.wav|67|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_373.wav|25|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_061.wav|20|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_391.wav|33|All were believed to be adults.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_174.wav|67|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_230.wav|104|Who will run the bigger show?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_295.wav|94|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_284.wav|42|They were not up to the required standard.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_054.wav|23|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_067.wav|50|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_223.wav|26|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_271.wav|75|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_320.wav|9|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_354.wav|54|It was a long process, but we got there.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_033.wav|86|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_072.wav|89|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_372.wav|54|There is nothing like a fresh start.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_248.wav|30|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_264.wav|85|This is still happening in the US.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_022.wav|96|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_092.wav|56|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_159.wav|92|I feel alive and good today.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_121.wav|70|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_016.wav|75|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_003.wav|76|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_164.wav|19|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_106.wav|107|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_105.wav|83|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_087.wav|107|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_434.wav|50|But it can be done.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_358.wav|64|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_178.wav|82|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_328.wav|4|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_108.wav|37|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_360.wav|55|They had better be.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_277.wav|71|"You've got to have both sides."
DUMMY2/p240/p240_348.wav|93|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_061.wav|19|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_361.wav|13|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_150.wav|66|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_012.wav|101|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_236.wav|37|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_011.wav|52|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_299.wav|13|I'm going to miss it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_060.wav|45|I fell against him.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_399.wav|26|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_063.wav|7|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_331.wav|80|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_030.wav|35|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_219.wav|48|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_415.wav|51|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_371.wav|96|The scene is about this ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_015.wav|105|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_127.wav|60|We are under no illusions about this.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_205.wav|103|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_195.wav|6|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_068.wav|53|But it was not all bad news.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_425.wav|48|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_179.wav|45|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_394.wav|40|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_198.wav|78|I would like to continue to develop.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_106.wav|82|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_125.wav|53|I think there's not much between them.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_089.wav|57|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_285.wav|20|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_164.wav|40|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_282.wav|37|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_282.wav|53|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_004.wav|92|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_020.wav|81|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_163.wav|68|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_445.wav|39|No, because it was too many.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_173.wav|78|We were all over the place in the first half.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_319.wav|56|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_134.wav|99|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_397.wav|40|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_294.wav|64|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_096.wav|63|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_307.wav|105|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_081.wav|83|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_053.wav|38|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_159.wav|67|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_296.wav|51|What are you going to do exactly?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_407.wav|72|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_094.wav|53|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_092.wav|98|Singing is my first love.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_079.wav|27|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_260.wav|33|I think it was his parents.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_301.wav|101|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_199.wav|80|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_223.wav|50|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_098.wav|92|The time of judgment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_251.wav|4|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_036.wav|93|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_354.wav|87|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_273.wav|74|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_345.wav|42|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_266.wav|94|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_421.wav|4|It's very difficult and very worrying.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_016.wav|29|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_326.wav|84|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_396.wav|26|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_088.wav|35|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_339.wav|41|It was good for us that they lost that day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_423.wav|20|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_341.wav|58|We just need the Government to act.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_046.wav|5|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_290.wav|65|He died the following year.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_251.wav|82|We were extremely arrogant.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_340.wav|103|It is now time for justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_384.wav|66|We only lost the third goal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_245.wav|13|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_209.wav|64|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_072.wav|39|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_087.wav|4|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_235.wav|93|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_118.wav|72|How can we ignore it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_401.wav|85|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_003.wav|48|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_439.wav|24|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_220.wav|9|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_293.wav|27|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_116.wav|11|If that is not a warning, what is it?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_366.wav|29|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_140.wav|48|So it was at Easter Road.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_223.wav|90|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_249.wav|61|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_390.wav|77|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_162.wav|89|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_151.wav|39|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_155.wav|19|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_344.wav|43|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_224.wav|84|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_268.wav|32|This will save interest charges.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_460.wav|7|It is pretty bad news.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_165.wav|94|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_207.wav|69|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_223.wav|75|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_270.wav|96|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_009.wav|46|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_089.wav|26|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_011.wav|76|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_343.wav|69|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_264.wav|21|There is no room for error.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_041.wav|102|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_258.wav|42|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_265.wav|87|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_180.wav|12|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_420.wav|103|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_282.wav|26|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_297.wav|96|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_164.wav|98|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_141.wav|68|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_072.wav|31|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_058.wav|72|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_232.wav|7|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_034.wav|37|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_268.wav|4|There is no point in denying that.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_301.wav|14|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_193.wav|13|How can they get one?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_069.wav|14|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_123.wav|57|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_220.wav|79|It is an outrage.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_319.wav|75|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_149.wav|30|Well, it's not before time, is it?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_207.wav|102|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_240.wav|21|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_187.wav|99|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_178.wav|4|I was delighted with every one of them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_416.wav|34|There is a spring in the step.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_158.wav|15|However, the story has a happy ending.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_260.wav|13|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_102.wav|37|It's very dangerous for markets.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_014.wav|46|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_373.wav|77|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_094.wav|87|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_299.wav|48|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_257.wav|58|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_335.wav|57|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_419.wav|11|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_031.wav|69|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_397.wav|62|And we all understand that.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_220.wav|61|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_285.wav|80|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_060.wav|55|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_246.wav|82|I am appalled by this news.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_207.wav|89|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_212.wav|8|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_023.wav|35|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_196.wav|61|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_028.wav|39|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_349.wav|70|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_396.wav|77|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_072.wav|75|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_404.wav|64|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_075.wav|29|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_077.wav|65|The time has arrived for a review.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_109.wav|6|It can be very worrying.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_351.wav|5|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_373.wav|68|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_152.wav|16|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_329.wav|62|It's all happening at a local level.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_306.wav|100|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_025.wav|77|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_314.wav|53|He felt too close to head office.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_346.wav|77|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_292.wav|17|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_196.wav|74|There is no other way.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_243.wav|101|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_097.wav|73|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_323.wav|40|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_050.wav|14|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_161.wav|37|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_254.wav|4|That's my daughter acting.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_366.wav|69|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_270.wav|18|It is, but that's not the point.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_037.wav|68|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_085.wav|104|It is the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_134.wav|81|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_089.wav|102|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_042.wav|95|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_017.wav|61|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_157.wav|9|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_277.wav|70|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_059.wav|37|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_398.wav|29|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_373.wav|64|This is important for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_138.wav|52|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_318.wav|90|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_056.wav|54|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_087.wav|57|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_298.wav|88|It's going to be tough.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_169.wav|100|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_120.wav|100|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_005.wav|91|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_107.wav|94|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_080.wav|85|They control the prices paid to farmers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_328.wav|72|Who honestly expected anything else?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_355.wav|65|Her father had died recently.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_329.wav|45|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_278.wav|1|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_070.wav|38|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_001.wav|70|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_008.wav|65|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p345/p345_288.wav|82|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_301.wav|58|Now there's an even bigger target.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_031.wav|64|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_056.wav|0|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_313.wav|26|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_059.wav|78|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_355.wav|81|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_009.wav|88|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_128.wav|20|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_212.wav|83|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_358.wav|57|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_349.wav|95|He did that every night I was with him.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_193.wav|83|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_397.wav|95|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_235.wav|6|Will you just put it away?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_349.wav|59|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_349.wav|78|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_154.wav|80|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_158.wav|7|I haven't made any definite decisions.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_395.wav|54|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_068.wav|21|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_241.wav|85|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_211.wav|17|He is a Satan.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_368.wav|89|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_312.wav|56|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_144.wav|92|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_332.wav|64|That is as it may be.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_185.wav|0|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_151.wav|1|They have worked with each other.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_419.wav|4|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_110.wav|75|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_366.wav|6|It is not needed, it should go.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_373.wav|85|I know we can play a lot better.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_175.wav|36|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_416.wav|35|No date has been set for a meeting.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_204.wav|85|He confirmed his fitness.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_008.wav|25|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_018.wav|58|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_136.wav|94|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_188.wav|56|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_050.wav|88|What do you think they said?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_004.wav|62|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_007.wav|90|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_122.wav|75|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_275.wav|79|It is still under discussion with the board.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_406.wav|36|He took a draw on his cigarette.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_290.wav|83|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_289.wav|53|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_090.wav|0|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_225.wav|106|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_012.wav|24|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_334.wav|104|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_414.wav|76|We never agreed to it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_039.wav|2|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_175.wav|29|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_012.wav|11|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_014.wav|26|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_212.wav|57|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_224.wav|34|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_150.wav|62|We still have a long, long way to go.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_185.wav|81|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_145.wav|62|He, too, was not satisfied.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_357.wav|4|They should have listened to me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_048.wav|44|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_304.wav|62|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p249/p249_135.wav|80|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_328.wav|42|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_353.wav|84|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_353.wav|41|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_329.wav|43|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_351.wav|74|I'm looking forward to coming home.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_288.wav|19|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_362.wav|87|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_155.wav|41|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_206.wav|95|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_161.wav|10|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_245.wav|91|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_100.wav|82|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_395.wav|24|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_403.wav|97|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_246.wav|32|I was just a kid.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_131.wav|73|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_062.wav|60|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_096.wav|18|What will it be?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_138.wav|75|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_251.wav|17|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_020.wav|25|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_198.wav|107|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_033.wav|100|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_051.wav|70|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_420.wav|39|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_266.wav|19|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_036.wav|74|Who was that?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_080.wav|84|On the night, it was not enough.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_371.wav|87|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_438.wav|75|I chose to make a film.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_222.wav|6|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_013.wav|14|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p226/p226_017.wav|43|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_196.wav|105|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_124.wav|104|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_021.wav|46|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_125.wav|70|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_381.wav|13|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_480.wav|24|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_140.wav|4|It's a horrific incident.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_367.wav|58|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_161.wav|86|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_197.wav|21|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_398.wav|33|I only wanted to give her a fright.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_228.wav|64|But Annika is just amazing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_306.wav|14|Motherwell have no such good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_075.wav|61|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_043.wav|63|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_421.wav|18|He did very well, but didn't win.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_178.wav|64|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_356.wav|70|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_218.wav|103|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_261.wav|10|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_098.wav|39|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_185.wav|48|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_238.wav|19|There is nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_118.wav|12|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_128.wav|55|Evidence must not be held back.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_276.wav|46|Arguably, they have already done it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_099.wav|79|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_275.wav|24|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_135.wav|46|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_419.wav|39|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_191.wav|21|That tells you something.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_148.wav|56|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_096.wav|38|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_356.wav|58|But my heart is in athletics.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_283.wav|90|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_038.wav|21|We are a team of hard workers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_188.wav|103|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_159.wav|35|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_063.wav|22|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_015.wav|99|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_137.wav|2|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_034.wav|12|Blood samples have been taken.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_064.wav|73|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_177.wav|24|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_192.wav|23|But he is something special, is he not?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_257.wav|11|Our thoughts are with his family.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_056.wav|28|But they add up.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_296.wav|2|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_128.wav|0|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_014.wav|49|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_334.wav|2|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_102.wav|75|It became difficult for me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_090.wav|44|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_255.wav|56|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_168.wav|79|The game was there to be won.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_295.wav|28|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_274.wav|52|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_128.wav|95|From it emerged a cup.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_241.wav|61|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_014.wav|62|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_257.wav|3|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_073.wav|10|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_188.wav|30|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_021.wav|56|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_215.wav|67|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_032.wav|28|There we were on the first tee.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_313.wav|45|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_022.wav|56|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_209.wav|5|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_268.wav|62|We're still talking about it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_347.wav|78|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_162.wav|73|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_028.wav|74|It's a horrific incident.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_328.wav|3|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_325.wav|68|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_230.wav|102|This is all part of opening the door.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_282.wav|95|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_350.wav|62|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_248.wav|9|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_144.wav|70|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_339.wav|100|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_098.wav|72|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_111.wav|10|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_332.wav|105|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_249.wav|47|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_409.wav|100|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_281.wav|93|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_103.wav|55|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_119.wav|67|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_112.wav|20|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_115.wav|87|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_336.wav|36|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_317.wav|84|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_174.wav|45|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_382.wav|46|Election results are expected soon.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_107.wav|53|They are a different team at home.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_260.wav|6|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_399.wav|68|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_349.wav|26|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_202.wav|51|We don't want to be too intrusive.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_230.wav|37|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_137.wav|63|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_362.wav|45|That would help.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_059.wav|103|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_142.wav|1|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_013.wav|37|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_100.wav|14|And they had a case.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_174.wav|74|But he was a really nice man.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_122.wav|5|It is not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_282.wav|3|My view has always been the same.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_063.wav|76|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_275.wav|70|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_208.wav|7|He was then replaced by Ross.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_177.wav|100|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_340.wav|16|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_297.wav|106|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_282.wav|22|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_114.wav|13|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_038.wav|45|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_264.wav|5|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_174.wav|25|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_166.wav|44|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_054.wav|16|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_163.wav|17|I was over the moon.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_346.wav|59|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_176.wav|79|If they wish to go, they can go.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_159.wav|8|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_331.wav|14|This is a moment to seize.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_304.wav|41|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_439.wav|37|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_367.wav|8|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_104.wav|19|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_340.wav|22|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_043.wav|46|He had a really frustrating time last year.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_349.wav|15|So there we are.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_044.wav|28|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_078.wav|71|"It is not long term, but I need time to recover."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_373.wav|66|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_317.wav|70|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_377.wav|95|I said she was very young.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_226.wav|75|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_063.wav|11|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_175.wav|78|All the pressure was on him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_058.wav|6|We were upset about the referee.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_154.wav|82|Normally it would be four minutes.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_002.wav|46|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_006.wav|34|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_105.wav|29|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_140.wav|40|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_345.wav|5|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_025.wav|13|I was not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_402.wav|32|Clark is back on top form.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_121.wav|92|This is a test of our character.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_049.wav|105|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_182.wav|94|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_269.wav|56|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_218.wav|10|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_032.wav|49|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_217.wav|75|John Daly has a burning ambition.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_170.wav|67|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_011.wav|10|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_111.wav|57|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_412.wav|78|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_037.wav|6|It's on with a roller.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_021.wav|48|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_153.wav|62|Where does it come from?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_016.wav|84|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_174.wav|104|These things can happen.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_184.wav|29|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_048.wav|70|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_247.wav|92|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_008.wav|2|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_105.wav|96|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_415.wav|65|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_251.wav|3|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_453.wav|32|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_256.wav|98|All my training is for Athens.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_139.wav|102|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_115.wav|103|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_027.wav|25|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_247.wav|80|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_146.wav|4|They did not let him down.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_074.wav|32|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_376.wav|22|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_176.wav|93|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_084.wav|82|All our futures will already have been decided.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_289.wav|50|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_037.wav|28|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_071.wav|69|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_075.wav|54|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_231.wav|83|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_147.wav|34|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_365.wav|82|Her life is now back on track.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_102.wav|3|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_004.wav|49|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_320.wav|92|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_147.wav|12|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_148.wav|37|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_181.wav|26|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_342.wav|21|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_051.wav|47|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_353.wav|89|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_397.wav|23|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_299.wav|30|I really don't understand what is happening.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_218.wav|107|They could go no further forward.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_333.wav|44|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_269.wav|67|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_267.wav|35|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_088.wav|39|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_321.wav|65|We want immediate action.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_332.wav|57|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_245.wav|48|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_289.wav|103|I have worked with him on projects.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_157.wav|58|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_063.wav|54|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_209.wav|27|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_252.wav|30|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_273.wav|51|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_296.wav|98|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_232.wav|37|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_192.wav|20|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_037.wav|47|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_167.wav|35|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_062.wav|29|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_379.wav|92|Surely the answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_345.wav|22|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_073.wav|47|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_043.wav|22|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_172.wav|66|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_348.wav|99|But nothing happened.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_035.wav|74|They were appalling, disgraceful.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_324.wav|76|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_228.wav|17|Things are moving together.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_246.wav|1|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_156.wav|20|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_181.wav|93|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_146.wav|69|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_043.wav|41|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_204.wav|78|It is not an issue.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_268.wav|71|"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_169.wav|96|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_424.wav|95|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_355.wav|77|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_061.wav|101|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_056.wav|64|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_189.wav|88|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_037.wav|65|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_268.wav|2|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_193.wav|12|You look at them and you understand.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_245.wav|70|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_291.wav|74|What will happen to them now?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_237.wav|83|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_433.wav|95|I would rather look at him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_212.wav|82|He would have come into the house.

DUMMY2/p334/p334_172.wav|38|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_104.wav|101|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_040.wav|41|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_266.wav|86|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_279.wav|55|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_230.wav|10|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_421.wav|64|Three months or so later, they are returning.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_185.wav|104|It's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_387.wav|27|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_171.wav|57|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_033.wav|93|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_073.wav|16|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_365.wav|40|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_163.wav|38|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_055.wav|42|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_284.wav|66|We've got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_217.wav|106|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_041.wav|68|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_109.wav|101|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_270.wav|32|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_045.wav|101|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_060.wav|5|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_083.wav|32|Our mother is very worried.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_083.wav|60|You will be very welcome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_238.wav|31|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_372.wav|74|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_322.wav|24|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_113.wav|16|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_420.wav|72|That, though, was then.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_282.wav|39|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_080.wav|10|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_257.wav|75|I was just a kid.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_236.wav|104|I just have to accept that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_390.wav|85|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_399.wav|65|But it is her picture.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_119.wav|53|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_406.wav|14|But the foundations have been laid.)

DUMMY2/p316/p316_386.wav|85|I couldn't get out of bed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_381.wav|2|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_332.wav|59|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_310.wav|81|You should be.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_045.wav|50|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_156.wav|70|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_262.wav|42|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_133.wav|29|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_200.wav|59|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_395.wav|78|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_244.wav|59|There will be widespread support on all sides.

DUMMY2/p260/p260_288.wav|81|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_358.wav|39|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_246.wav|14|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_178.wav|91|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_061.wav|85|Everyone was very saddened.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_073.wav|55|None has ever been found.

DUMMY2/p313/p313_129.wav|76|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_150.wav|101|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_206.wav|9|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_393.wav|20|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_210.wav|64|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_203.wav|23|Nothing is ruled out.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_410.wav|107|There are simply no orders.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_038.wav|18|You go in there and do it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_108.wav|20|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_182.wav|39|It's nice to be involved.

DUMMY2/p271/p271_024.wav|27|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_093.wav|100|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_105.wav|102|People just came on their own.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_234.wav|43|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_344.wav|28|The then secretary was not amused.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_116.wav|93|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.

DUMMY2/p270/p270_022.wav|8|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_037.wav|69|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_230.wav|45|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_086.wav|38|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_243.wav|22|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_180.wav|16|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.

DUMMY2/p306/p306_286.wav|12|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_142.wav|95|Last night, the row continued.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_036.wav|48|That can cost him a fortune.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_336.wav|7|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_457.wav|32|We're still the only ones in the High Street.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_390.wav|6|You have to go for it.

DUMMY2/p301/p301_313.wav|91|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_032.wav|97|The country is in a state of chaos.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_004.wav|2|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_025.wav|38|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_242.wav|73|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_138.wav|78|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_289.wav|98|It has become very confused.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_302.wav|31|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_271.wav|29|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_010.wav|104|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_380.wav|68|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.

DUMMY2/p275/p275_222.wav|40|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_195.wav|62|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_335.wav|47|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_132.wav|50|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_083.wav|42|Its first awards will do just that.

DUMMY2/p376/p376_007.wav|71|"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "
DUMMY2/p266/p266_246.wav|20|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_324.wav|43|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_320.wav|61|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_232.wav|79|I will never see my son again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_072.wav|99|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_138.wav|17|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_381.wav|65|People could have a post box in the local post office.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_393.wav|28|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_279.wav|107|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_348.wav|62|We told them in June.

DUMMY2/p253/p253_339.wav|70|She is free.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_273.wav|72|It was a very difficult period.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_189.wav|77|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_207.wav|5|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_313.wav|95|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_301.wav|1|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_240.wav|62|Our commitment is to move forward.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_030.wav|63|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_077.wav|99|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_227.wav|66|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_173.wav|60|Hopefully it will be a good day.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_259.wav|62|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_078.wav|99|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_089.wav|39|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_188.wav|20|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_041.wav|29|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_356.wav|62|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_016.wav|85|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_146.wav|18|But it does not matter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_196.wav|40|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_259.wav|83|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_231.wav|22|He said because people had invited him.

DUMMY2/p262/p262_049.wav|45|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_239.wav|50|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_357.wav|107|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_071.wav|100|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_195.wav|44|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_296.wav|29|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_136.wav|72|That statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_242.wav|60|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_222.wav|27|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_312.wav|106|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_145.wav|41|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_169.wav|97|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_322.wav|34|But it wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_039.wav|20|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_153.wav|39|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_367.wav|48|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_092.wav|46|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_262.wav|12|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_277.wav|30|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_126.wav|81|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_267.wav|72|I can certainly see much better.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_352.wav|105|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_002.wav|56|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_283.wav|64|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_037.wav|62|That decision is now being appealed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_216.wav|22|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_353.wav|34|At the same time it is a satire.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_274.wav|26|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_117.wav|2|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_250.wav|6|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_209.wav|22|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_194.wav|74|I would be interested in another attempt.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_062.wav|26|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_408.wav|100|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_027.wav|35|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_041.wav|10|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_002.wav|60|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_397.wav|51|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_164.wav|9|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_329.wav|89|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_111.wav|106|He's been active in Arabia.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_096.wav|20|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_197.wav|64|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_059.wav|74|He would have been wrong.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_155.wav|53|Time may already have run out for this option.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_346.wav|62|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_221.wav|3|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.

DUMMY2/p263/p263_258.wav|39|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_139.wav|24|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_384.wav|1|So people will come out with these things.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_384.wav|19|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_289.wav|99|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_140.wav|32|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_274.wav|91|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_019.wav|45|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_051.wav|88|There will be no disruption in the schools.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_147.wav|101|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_129.wav|15|I feel it's time to make the switch.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_308.wav|8|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_367.wav|46|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_303.wav|103|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_355.wav|7|We want to play at the worlds.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_157.wav|23|Horses have some sense.

DUMMY2/p229/p229_329.wav|67|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_187.wav|10|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_236.wav|107|There is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_468.wav|65|He dismissed the action.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_152.wav|23|I think we have a very strong case.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_253.wav|58|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_473.wav|50|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_142.wav|76|It's typical of me.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_379.wav|15|The results are tragic.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_398.wav|51|The conclusion is enthralling.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_003.wav|70|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_293.wav|55|He is a good signing for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_364.wav|4|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_074.wav|95|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_222.wav|46|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_164.wav|61|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_105.wav|95|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_029.wav|98|Are we not men?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_003.wav|49|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_237.wav|46|Stalkers are capable of killing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_096.wav|87|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_247.wav|22|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_142.wav|13|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_083.wav|44|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_283.wav|68|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_454.wav|37|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_328.wav|2|The outcome is not in doubt.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_096.wav|81|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_133.wav|86|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_337.wav|60|A child is not a product.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_181.wav|31|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_384.wav|55|No real attempt was made to get orders.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_396.wav|55|The new manager must make tough decisions.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_082.wav|107|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_078.wav|53|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_241.wav|18|Are you going to win?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_331.wav|89|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_113.wav|24|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_395.wav|36|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_152.wav|74|This is not quite right.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_121.wav|55|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_024.wav|74|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_394.wav|56|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_154.wav|100|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_172.wav|77|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_408.wav|4|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_070.wav|88|They've got more time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_037.wav|50|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_309.wav|80|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_391.wav|50|The response from them was good.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_157.wav|99|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_374.wav|7|Finally came the moment of truth.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_077.wav|19|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_176.wav|25|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_089.wav|73|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_409.wav|42|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_171.wav|72|I've got three other ideas for the day.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_293.wav|57|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_410.wav|77|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_147.wav|40|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_196.wav|76|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_004.wav|65|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_265.wav|31|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_257.wav|42|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_172.wav|40|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_249.wav|91|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_051.wav|71|"He looks like an Afghan."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_366.wav|45|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_339.wav|89|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_254.wav|69|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_439.wav|14|An alternative must be offered.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_186.wav|2|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_247.wav|12|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_328.wav|100|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_175.wav|46|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_413.wav|72|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_221.wav|72|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_140.wav|16|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_252.wav|100|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_063.wav|81|They are real.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_278.wav|85|Footballers have also been targeted.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_106.wav|61|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_296.wav|16|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_174.wav|55|It was clearly not a battle.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_191.wav|16|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_390.wav|52|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_096.wav|44|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_340.wav|57|He's a genius.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_353.wav|97|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_365.wav|1|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_411.wav|69|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_213.wav|17|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_138.wav|5|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_095.wav|41|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_297.wav|10|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_452.wav|63|No further details of expansion plans were given.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_338.wav|23|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_109.wav|44|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_303.wav|3|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_396.wav|50|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_424.wav|11|It will be crucial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_083.wav|78|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_420.wav|78|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_090.wav|81|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_396.wav|95|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_007.wav|75|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_225.wav|94|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_019.wav|2|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_139.wav|46|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_010.wav|4|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_342.wav|55|They will now remain split up.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_231.wav|59|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_327.wav|75|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_322.wav|103|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_078.wav|44|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_024.wav|46|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_342.wav|70|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_358.wav|101|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_316.wav|5|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_178.wav|99|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_044.wav|7|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_299.wav|45|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_186.wav|69|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_350.wav|0|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_055.wav|31|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_237.wav|98|These were the dreams.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_323.wav|58|He's very young but he is growing up.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_256.wav|9|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_262.wav|16|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_267.wav|33|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_326.wav|37|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_098.wav|51|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_024.wav|1|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_074.wav|77|We did it for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_215.wav|76|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_062.wav|85|He declined to give further details.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_002.wav|14|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY2/p239/p239_158.wav|48|Our relationship has been very good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_409.wav|20|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_014.wav|67|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_330.wav|40|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_286.wav|14|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_198.wav|52|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_102.wav|80|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_041.wav|70|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_155.wav|75|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_337.wav|46|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_035.wav|55|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_133.wav|22|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_323.wav|76|As if they ever stopped.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_368.wav|33|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_204.wav|23|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_381.wav|49|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_057.wav|101|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_213.wav|5|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_180.wav|45|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_115.wav|22|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_219.wav|30|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_328.wav|76|It went on to become an annual event.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_239.wav|4|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_127.wav|15|Well, you don't have time.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_346.wav|5|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_141.wav|55|But this wasn't the full picture.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_403.wav|65|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_368.wav|55|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_372.wav|41|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_418.wav|24|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_205.wav|77|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_464.wav|106|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_310.wav|59|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_110.wav|61|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_161.wav|66|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_175.wav|28|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_295.wav|32|This is a great opportunity for us.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_324.wav|52|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_361.wav|96|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_319.wav|25|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_294.wav|73|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_139.wav|37|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_135.wav|50|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_160.wav|74|Surely it can't get any worse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_195.wav|68|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_054.wav|55|Schools will not want change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_225.wav|67|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_334.wav|40|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_137.wav|54|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_242.wav|29|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_082.wav|99|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_245.wav|11|It is just so sad.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_293.wav|83|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_475.wav|48|I am sorry, but I forgot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_267.wav|85|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_018.wav|59|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_337.wav|1|You let a lot of people down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_041.wav|7|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_204.wav|55|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_373.wav|28|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_284.wav|107|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_228.wav|1|All these women were actors.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_372.wav|36|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_336.wav|85|There will be no receivers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_061.wav|91|That is why we want this decision reversed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_176.wav|18|This was certainly not about money.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_365.wav|35|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_339.wav|74|It has been an extremely long haul.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_106.wav|73|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_260.wav|54|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_256.wav|62|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_273.wav|21|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_428.wav|8|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_218.wav|75|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_421.wav|95|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_331.wav|32|She had gone to the Catholic school.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_125.wav|19|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_285.wav|28|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_230.wav|41|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_048.wav|97|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_198.wav|76|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_093.wav|104|But now it's back to golf.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_325.wav|65|They should try to get tickets.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_109.wav|9|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_378.wav|64|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_171.wav|39|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_100.wav|38|Justice was not seen today.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_040.wav|54|It would show them a positive way forward.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_152.wav|15|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_113.wav|59|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_060.wav|51|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_052.wav|24|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_312.wav|38|The public have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_015.wav|22|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_177.wav|84|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_255.wav|5|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_220.wav|11|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_260.wav|90|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_019.wav|73|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_184.wav|22|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_185.wav|56|We've had an enjoyable adventure.

DUMMY2/p274/p274_067.wav|32|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_404.wav|76|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_303.wav|58|No decision on that was taken.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_421.wav|60|There was no happy ending.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_013.wav|89|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_326.wav|80|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_070.wav|20|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_323.wav|67|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_212.wav|106|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_020.wav|96|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_415.wav|27|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_042.wav|37|We want to get back into the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_018.wav|73|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_060.wav|82|No casualties were reported.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_107.wav|103|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_188.wav|93|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_253.wav|36|The pig industry is on its knees.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_172.wav|12|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_301.wav|44|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_080.wav|42|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_035.wav|0|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_328.wav|38|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_132.wav|51|That's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_105.wav|15|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_373.wav|93|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_158.wav|33|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_127.wav|58|I've just got to build on this now.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_320.wav|57|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_062.wav|88|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_231.wav|61|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_315.wav|98|But he made a mistake in picking it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_393.wav|103|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_145.wav|67|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_080.wav|32|The ethos of the school was outstanding.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_245.wav|31|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_246.wav|60|Just one of those things, we suppose.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_337.wav|94|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_008.wav|78|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_190.wav|81|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_316.wav|82|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_315.wav|23|We will build upon the basic state pension.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_134.wav|90|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_354.wav|5|That would help.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_341.wav|96|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_361.wav|85|It certainly gives you hope.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_371.wav|19|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_411.wav|38|He added, We are not prepared for war.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_296.wav|83|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_321.wav|42|He was caught and fired.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_363.wav|63|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_157.wav|12|You might even have seen him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_332.wav|60|I don't think he played his best.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_109.wav|85|I was not a joiner.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_096.wav|25|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_037.wav|18|I don't think the action was a mistake.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_349.wav|64|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_315.wav|89|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_190.wav|85|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_079.wav|11|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_248.wav|67|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_212.wav|88|I can handle the pace.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_098.wav|80|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_360.wav|31|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_196.wav|70|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_283.wav|28|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_136.wav|39|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_310.wav|22|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_057.wav|7|Let's hope that it does.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_064.wav|93|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_023.wav|21|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_433.wav|14|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_103.wav|47|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_195.wav|33|I now know that from memory.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_357.wav|8|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_347.wav|49|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_077.wav|92|He said, My own position is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_101.wav|31|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_229.wav|17|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_375.wav|53|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_082.wav|6|That can only be a good thing.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_423.wav|89|I am extremely cautious.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_188.wav|79|This is positive and welcome.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_396.wav|11|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_413.wav|49|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_228.wav|44|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_404.wav|1|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_105.wav|5|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_369.wav|54|Now there is an even bigger target.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_039.wav|16|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_347.wav|39|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_286.wav|56|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_394.wav|50|That's as good as it gets.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_326.wav|41|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_063.wav|74|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_244.wav|8|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_130.wav|105|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_003.wav|47|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_138.wav|35|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_370.wav|19|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_467.wav|50|Classes must be reduced by half.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_304.wav|2|It needs a team approach.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_009.wav|38|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_133.wav|59|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_096.wav|61|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_344.wav|25|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_008.wav|4|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_209.wav|77|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_135.wav|98|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_250.wav|72|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_305.wav|11|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_182.wav|47|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_040.wav|20|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_331.wav|67|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_059.wav|19|It's back to how it used to be.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_264.wav|35|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_295.wav|105|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_275.wav|85|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_245.wav|99|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_045.wav|12|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_301.wav|4|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_166.wav|71|"I was in the train station overnight."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_108.wav|50|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_242.wav|91|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_106.wav|68|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_132.wav|54|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_471.wav|100|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_153.wav|9|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_192.wav|44|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_098.wav|24|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_048.wav|72|We are waiting for advice on the film.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_193.wav|101|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_070.wav|86|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_021.wav|21|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_204.wav|41|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_284.wav|51|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_134.wav|39|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_375.wav|92|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_195.wav|104|It is misleading to compare the two.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_306.wav|10|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_124.wav|85|The two sets are different.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_183.wav|43|I have no sympathy with her at all.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_304.wav|65|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_057.wav|18|Are they going to work together again?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_433.wav|37|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_124.wav|94|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_212.wav|24|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_275.wav|41|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_248.wav|2|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_254.wav|38|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_047.wav|83|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_033.wav|82|It's a lot of pressure on me.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_308.wav|103|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_149.wav|16|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_355.wav|58|This is normal for him now.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_248.wav|60|No one was injured.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_337.wav|99|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_019.wav|92|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_147.wav|72|They were due to have begun today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_095.wav|33|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_034.wav|54|We have high hopes that this will work.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_244.wav|90|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_291.wav|43|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_148.wav|50|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_346.wav|105|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_242.wav|67|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_291.wav|21|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_042.wav|96|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_119.wav|9|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_191.wav|33|This was a great result for us, a big result.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_240.wav|43|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_267.wav|70|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_449.wav|32|It is pretty bad news.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_033.wav|55|Just look at his fashion sense.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_221.wav|67|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_115.wav|5|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_324.wav|33|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_018.wav|63|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_398.wav|34|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_354.wav|32|The pain is still acute.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_129.wav|103|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_330.wav|13|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_386.wav|105|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_097.wav|56|But the battle has only just begun.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_247.wav|65|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_348.wav|74|I am an innocent man.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_131.wav|48|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_005.wav|39|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_011.wav|5|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_275.wav|10|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_046.wav|41|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_331.wav|58|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_079.wav|16|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_151.wav|20|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_325.wav|12|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_292.wav|97|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_139.wav|79|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_060.wav|41|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_132.wav|98|I just have no maternal instincts.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_222.wav|34|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_430.wav|36|Once again, they would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_345.wav|32|Our season is not finished.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_328.wav|8|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_262.wav|27|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_027.wav|32|Drugs are a serious problem.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_213.wav|47|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_054.wav|75|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_117.wav|42|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_114.wav|27|I am an actor.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_279.wav|35|There is a case to answer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_385.wav|95|That can be good for us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_071.wav|51|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_354.wav|29|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_292.wav|35|It is a recipe for success.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_350.wav|52|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_249.wav|103|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_280.wav|55|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_023.wav|52|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_404.wav|47|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_314.wav|7|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_213.wav|98|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_265.wav|75|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_002.wav|93|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_259.wav|8|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_205.wav|78|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_265.wav|57|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_370.wav|48|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_228.wav|36|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_294.wav|26|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_028.wav|7|I am pretty careful with money.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_184.wav|90|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_242.wav|30|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_207.wav|91|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_213.wav|94|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_056.wav|65|So is that it, then?)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_320.wav|99|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_010.wav|106|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_323.wav|13|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_221.wav|4|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_292.wav|37|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_247.wav|16|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_078.wav|37|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_205.wav|46|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_186.wav|59|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_168.wav|44|Can they be serious?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_288.wav|91|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_028.wav|8|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_025.wav|4|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_325.wav|42|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_089.wav|10|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_101.wav|8|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_209.wav|40|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_123.wav|13|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_350.wav|1|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_310.wav|76|And we've beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_322.wav|49|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_157.wav|73|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_361.wav|16|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_200.wav|35|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_086.wav|30|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_081.wav|21|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_086.wav|29|This is a complex and detailed report.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_425.wav|39|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_186.wav|24|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_211.wav|106|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_162.wav|81|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_115.wav|2|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_376.wav|32|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_184.wav|42|I think we've got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_267.wav|100|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_066.wav|106|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_283.wav|32|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_104.wav|87|He will be kept informed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_170.wav|68|That, in our view, is an important decision.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_377.wav|1|We are waiting for them to calm down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_193.wav|62|There was no question of him not impressing.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_022.wav|39|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_066.wav|62|Will you just put it away?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_074.wav|64|That would have killed the match.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_355.wav|11|But happily, the story is true.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_068.wav|78|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_059.wav|2|They are real.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_402.wav|64|There is a great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_374.wav|17|There may be some evidence to this effect.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_119.wav|15|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_167.wav|38|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_268.wav|41|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_229.wav|62|We're going to see more extreme weather.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_272.wav|17|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_299.wav|76|The incident is being taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_321.wav|59|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_407.wav|51|The review has been conducted fairly.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_390.wav|23|All were within range of Israeli cities.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_254.wav|83|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_031.wav|63|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_125.wav|74|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_127.wav|101|It is a common problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_263.wav|48|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_088.wav|66|I still feel like a wee boy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_280.wav|10|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_193.wav|71|"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address."
DUMMY2/p282/p282_156.wav|83|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_099.wav|14|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_206.wav|36|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_107.wav|3|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_019.wav|74|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_078.wav|41|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_332.wav|42|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_165.wav|32|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_302.wav|48|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_307.wav|27|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_019.wav|50|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_456.wav|37|Now it has doubled in size.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_025.wav|18|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_019.wav|10|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_104.wav|36|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_125.wav|93|I was furious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_153.wav|57|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_169.wav|39|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_018.wav|20|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_330.wav|31|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_348.wav|3|The answer was in space.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_096.wav|88|Allison is not convinced.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_374.wav|32|It had been a magical moment.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_044.wav|73|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_381.wav|98|It is already making a difference.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_394.wav|25|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_333.wav|64|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_235.wav|78|We have to win the group.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_182.wav|80|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_099.wav|30|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_217.wav|59|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_153.wav|105|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_095.wav|99|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_162.wav|70|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_273.wav|96|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_049.wav|97|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_109.wav|77|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_314.wav|100|His was a huge success story.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_408.wav|1|They offer a kind of narrative.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_052.wav|13|It was all for good reason as well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_225.wav|95|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_185.wav|66|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_363.wav|52|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_307.wav|100|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_451.wav|89|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_147.wav|61|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_131.wav|49|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_039.wav|86|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_027.wav|61|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_009.wav|105|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_332.wav|31|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_168.wav|36|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_180.wav|56|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_169.wav|45|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_167.wav|41|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_187.wav|36|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_130.wav|2|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_209.wav|7|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_418.wav|60|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_148.wav|100|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_184.wav|98|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_242.wav|5|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_103.wav|69|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_150.wav|7|The referee faces a massive job.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_140.wav|37|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_245.wav|72|We want to learn lessons from that.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_055.wav|13|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_140.wav|53|There was only one living room, you see.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_157.wav|62|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_151.wav|49|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_032.wav|99|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_221.wav|50|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_289.wav|1|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_002.wav|92|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_023.wav|4|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_085.wav|79|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_297.wav|36|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_262.wav|102|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_370.wav|67|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_276.wav|20|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_169.wav|21|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_410.wav|75|He may have a point.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_312.wav|7|It seemed a logical expansion.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_066.wav|102|He also does not get along with Christina.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_266.wav|88|This could be the case.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_355.wav|18|I thought to myself.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_352.wav|43|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_095.wav|73|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_085.wav|17|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_192.wav|4|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_065.wav|72|If you can get away with it, you do it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_187.wav|32|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_186.wav|29|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_321.wav|64|We are worried about casualties.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_007.wav|97|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_215.wav|2|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_275.wav|83|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_219.wav|98|I'm not interested in the job.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_058.wav|60|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_285.wav|4|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_130.wav|20|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_089.wav|24|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_376.wav|84|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_069.wav|12|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_302.wav|74|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_374.wav|68|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_139.wav|77|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_112.wav|68|Tell you the team he picked?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_116.wav|104|I want to make a vigorous defence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_166.wav|53|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_299.wav|98|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_173.wav|64|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_206.wav|12|It was turning that way all across Europe.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_042.wav|33|What are the barriers?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_095.wav|46|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_346.wav|14|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_165.wav|1|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_282.wav|97|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_186.wav|25|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_362.wav|0|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_145.wav|70|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_202.wav|45|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_234.wav|45|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_161.wav|91|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_243.wav|85|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_269.wav|27|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_360.wav|51|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_052.wav|83|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_410.wav|106|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_155.wav|76|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_287.wav|14|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_176.wav|53|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_291.wav|9|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_239.wav|63|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_208.wav|99|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_046.wav|83|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_136.wav|86|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_193.wav|58|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_023.wav|5|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_349.wav|80|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_320.wav|39|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_393.wav|82|I've never had problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_186.wav|53|A great player has to win major championships.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_060.wav|27|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_273.wav|43|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_012.wav|58|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_013.wav|107|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_391.wav|67|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_020.wav|91|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_309.wav|81|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_219.wav|64|If only we had known.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_058.wav|84|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_296.wav|84|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_229.wav|91|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_221.wav|100|Construction is due to begin in February.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_025.wav|21|I've got a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_014.wav|87|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_193.wav|99|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_043.wav|66|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_042.wav|64|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_094.wav|85|There are no problems between us at all.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_468.wav|32|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_265.wav|24|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_222.wav|93|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_381.wav|8|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_070.wav|30|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_115.wav|105|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_204.wav|44|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_324.wav|83|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_111.wav|60|People were hitting the floor.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_062.wav|24|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_283.wav|27|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_077.wav|91|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_266.wav|73|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_069.wav|51|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_301.wav|103|That is just a load of baloney.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_294.wav|79|No-one is a winner in this.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_006.wav|45|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_192.wav|105|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_083.wav|61|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_132.wav|47|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_452.wav|48|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_088.wav|100|It is high time to act.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_065.wav|1|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_328.wav|84|Who was the mystery MP ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_084.wav|63|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_405.wav|37|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_422.wav|79|It's really part of our mission.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_338.wav|91|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_443.wav|27|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_212.wav|65|Brian was last to join.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_269.wav|104|It is a common condition in children.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_057.wav|4|It ended as it began, in confusion.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_279.wav|75|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_284.wav|0|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_336.wav|41|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_121.wav|63|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_225.wav|77|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_371.wav|21|I have to take some of the blame.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_035.wav|73|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_289.wav|35|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_158.wav|99|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_231.wav|60|We've got better players here.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_135.wav|61|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_261.wav|50|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_067.wav|93|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_079.wav|57|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_033.wav|31|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_023.wav|75|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_218.wav|73|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_152.wav|99|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_286.wav|54|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_161.wav|45|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_105.wav|89|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_048.wav|74|None of the pieces was commissioned.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_238.wav|61|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_141.wav|96|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_355.wav|3|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_458.wav|106|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_096.wav|56|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_081.wav|93|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_306.wav|87|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_321.wav|3|You have to count on other people.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_166.wav|31|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_348.wav|97|I am awaiting a reply.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_008.wav|9|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_101.wav|84|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_103.wav|60|It is harder than you think.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_316.wav|77|The City welcomed the numbers.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_297.wav|11|I don't know them or anything.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_290.wav|46|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_253.wav|78|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_062.wav|62|The rest, of course, is history.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_030.wav|76|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_151.wav|102|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_381.wav|91|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_209.wav|99|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_159.wav|90|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_213.wav|97|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_107.wav|27|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_325.wav|102|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_134.wav|106|The excitement could hardly be contained.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_304.wav|48|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_325.wav|98|We don't have money to get to town.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_344.wav|5|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_015.wav|67|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_153.wav|77|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_167.wav|30|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_259.wav|52|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_014.wav|88|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_204.wav|54|It's a hidden problem.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_342.wav|57|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_279.wav|39|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_342.wav|86|I would miss him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_091.wav|56|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_311.wav|1|He will do very well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_273.wav|69|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_384.wav|92|We all started running forward.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_358.wav|91|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_383.wav|78|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_133.wav|76|I'm sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_354.wav|60|I would not do that.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_050.wav|84|The strategy is not without risk.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_163.wav|53|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_018.wav|48|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_161.wav|25|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_228.wav|26|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_013.wav|80|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_152.wav|105|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_180.wav|58|It's not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_140.wav|99|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_131.wav|77|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_370.wav|63|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_351.wav|47|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_078.wav|24|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_224.wav|91|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_013.wav|2|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_172.wav|53|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_380.wav|106|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_287.wav|83|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_395.wav|13|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_149.wav|37|And they all have a vote.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_106.wav|99|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_076.wav|19|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_042.wav|7|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_451.wav|37|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_035.wav|86|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_039.wav|30|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_093.wav|66|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_291.wav|104|There did not need to be a miracle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_029.wav|20|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_365.wav|11|My game is coming back.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_035.wav|13|You are in power.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_213.wav|48|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_318.wav|28|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_049.wav|60|But we are confident.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_328.wav|82|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_388.wav|107|We've got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_006.wav|77|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_102.wav|40|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_310.wav|77|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_409.wav|77|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_318.wav|9|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_171.wav|83|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_287.wav|91|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_375.wav|33|Our message is getting through.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_409.wav|95|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_135.wav|34|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_299.wav|77|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_202.wav|94|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_302.wav|69|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_327.wav|106|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_227.wav|78|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_021.wav|77|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_273.wav|81|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_278.wav|78|However, the matter is not going to end there.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_025.wav|33|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_286.wav|103|The manager is there to make these decisions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_276.wav|71|"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident."
DUMMY2/p256/p256_261.wav|90|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_062.wav|8|We have made a commitment to those people.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_349.wav|24|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_291.wav|84|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_228.wav|30|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_168.wav|72|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_092.wav|22|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_236.wav|82|I didn't know where they were.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_386.wav|2|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_295.wav|66|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_193.wav|77|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_221.wav|8|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_190.wav|90|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_387.wav|21|Because it's a secret.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_050.wav|45|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_163.wav|39|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_314.wav|41|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_385.wav|29|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_091.wav|10|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_372.wav|4|They really want to do it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_018.wav|51|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_216.wav|75|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_018.wav|78|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_101.wav|51|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_054.wav|90|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_011.wav|46|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_051.wav|39|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_415.wav|46|What exactly is your job?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_107.wav|14|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_236.wav|66|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_311.wav|5|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_394.wav|24|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_262.wav|97|There were no new cases yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_398.wav|19|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_117.wav|72|This is not about revenge.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_250.wav|41|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_288.wav|29|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_335.wav|40|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_038.wav|92|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_338.wav|53|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_097.wav|9|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_285.wav|103|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_355.wav|70|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_125.wav|35|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_145.wav|12|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_033.wav|50|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_020.wav|51|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_190.wav|10|I've always been like that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_140.wav|64|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_163.wav|56|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_258.wav|13|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_039.wav|34|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_058.wav|8|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_259.wav|22|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_376.wav|68|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_424.wav|33|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_176.wav|33|I think we're going to make it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_013.wav|100|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_008.wav|26|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_406.wav|95|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_080.wav|51|I'm not going to answer that right now.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_161.wav|18|What were they told?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_208.wav|105|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_420.wav|13|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_298.wav|90|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_437.wav|65|Special measures were needed.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_162.wav|57|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_424.wav|16|He is to appeal.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_206.wav|70|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_082.wav|15|It means the margin for error is tight.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_336.wav|101|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_095.wav|88|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_409.wav|18|What would you ask?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_033.wav|35|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_388.wav|35|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_311.wav|38|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_070.wav|59|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_030.wav|77|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_253.wav|91|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_131.wav|2|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_062.wav|107|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_135.wav|103|I have so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_099.wav|54|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_142.wav|0|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_266.wav|92|The bombing has had a huge influence.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_287.wav|63|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_393.wav|69|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_131.wav|31|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_008.wav|11|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_288.wav|14|None of this work is guaranteed.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_321.wav|46|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_022.wav|67|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_101.wav|6|I can't get it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_350.wav|14|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_333.wav|25|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_246.wav|45|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_159.wav|49|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_033.wav|4|She went home from school and never returned.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_358.wav|69|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_023.wav|55|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_135.wav|85|It would be difficult to argue with that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_107.wav|83|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_128.wav|73|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_059.wav|58|He added, It's not a racial problem.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_079.wav|88|He wanted to talk to me about it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_159.wav|66|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_402.wav|97|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_340.wav|60|I'm going to miss it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_371.wav|66|You are a liar.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_248.wav|31|It has been declared.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_165.wav|90|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_085.wav|90|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_291.wav|24|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_077.wav|13|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_300.wav|28|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_126.wav|0|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_032.wav|66|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_393.wav|22|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_129.wav|68|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_044.wav|99|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_159.wav|50|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_173.wav|71|"First and foremost, the game is entirely different."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_238.wav|77|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_213.wav|106|Some promoters made insulting offers.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_320.wav|12|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_254.wav|99|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_155.wav|62|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_144.wav|36|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_066.wav|103|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_125.wav|104|We have very real concerns about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_416.wav|51|I am in a very difficult position.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_110.wav|3|We are currently working on the details.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_354.wav|66|The workers said they were treated like animals.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_069.wav|0|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_233.wav|25|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_159.wav|77|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_157.wav|61|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_246.wav|26|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_123.wav|82|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_199.wav|70|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_218.wav|87|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_223.wav|93|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_366.wav|49|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_432.wav|95|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_168.wav|100|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_200.wav|23|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_042.wav|77|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_336.wav|89|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_138.wav|57|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_387.wav|62|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_304.wav|30|The snipers are also out.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_227.wav|54|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_091.wav|75|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_261.wav|4|I want to go now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_027.wav|98|It is deeply worrying.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_404.wav|92|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_012.wav|54|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_148.wav|3|It is expected to last a week.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_358.wav|59|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_162.wav|41|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_272.wav|96|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_273.wav|93|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_310.wav|17|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_094.wav|11|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_163.wav|16|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_151.wav|88|It was too soon.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_176.wav|10|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_442.wav|14|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_190.wav|87|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_378.wav|95|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_136.wav|2|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_148.wav|91|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_337.wav|34|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_337.wav|49|It is so damaging.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_018.wav|0|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_134.wav|48|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_306.wav|107|We're determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_236.wav|64|It is a big time for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_067.wav|26|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_114.wav|78|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_254.wav|72|And that includes the Barnett formula.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_121.wav|97|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_380.wav|8|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_335.wav|91|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_367.wav|9|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_111.wav|88|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_169.wav|73|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_035.wav|47|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_093.wav|98|When is it ever anything else?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_206.wav|19|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_344.wav|62|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_186.wav|33|We are still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_026.wav|7|Smoking is also very important.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_092.wav|29|For once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_283.wav|78|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_193.wav|7|You know the sort of thing.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_361.wav|20|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_140.wav|15|She was very different.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_228.wav|72|I don't think it is vital.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_216.wav|81|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_264.wav|63|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_318.wav|35|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_264.wav|91|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_300.wav|27|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_392.wav|0|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_339.wav|55|Because I think it's there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_411.wav|18|Where do we spend it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_319.wav|78|Look at the potential of this club.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_352.wav|64|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_347.wav|37|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_223.wav|99|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_422.wav|56|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_379.wav|27|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_155.wav|14|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_307.wav|11|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_015.wav|42|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_369.wav|40|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_326.wav|61|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_361.wav|22|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_033.wav|78|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_050.wav|37|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_362.wav|13|You can't give in to the vandals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_351.wav|21|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_334.wav|91|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_138.wav|74|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_100.wav|72|Did you get the script?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_221.wav|85|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_096.wav|6|Where will the money come from?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_164.wav|17|And really, the songs are the key thing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_130.wav|38|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_108.wav|22|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_287.wav|33|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_113.wav|1|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_151.wav|93|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_222.wav|10|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_341.wav|99|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_014.wav|8|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_215.wav|8|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_314.wav|62|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_193.wav|47|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_162.wav|18|More cases are expected.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_007.wav|93|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_175.wav|63|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_419.wav|74|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_241.wav|58|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_176.wav|16|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_233.wav|104|We have seen the future, and it is different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_294.wav|38|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_194.wav|71|"We've had an enjoyable adventure."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_106.wav|3|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_387.wav|91|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_206.wav|4|This has been a shock.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_206.wav|2|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_302.wav|7|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_231.wav|90|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_085.wav|21|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_190.wav|4|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_368.wav|38|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_127.wav|61|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_271.wav|63|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_070.wav|27|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_273.wav|78|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_233.wav|47|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_163.wav|90|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_314.wav|39|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_339.wav|57|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_294.wav|49|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_009.wav|90|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_047.wav|102|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_024.wav|21|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_229.wav|74|I really didn't think he would.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_136.wav|96|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_127.wav|8|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_217.wav|5|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_353.wav|92|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_285.wav|43|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_074.wav|84|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_054.wav|81|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_327.wav|13|They always seem to produce.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_292.wav|79|It was considered to be topical.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_405.wav|24|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_387.wav|72|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_059.wav|9|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_433.wav|100|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_373.wav|79|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_257.wav|5|I could have got out a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_154.wav|87|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_201.wav|55|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_274.wav|36|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_272.wav|29|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_304.wav|106|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_062.wav|44|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_140.wav|92|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_140.wav|72|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_103.wav|105|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_093.wav|71|"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_116.wav|34|No passengers were on board.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_125.wav|27|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_336.wav|78|It is a sensitive issue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_162.wav|102|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_144.wav|45|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_333.wav|29|It is so easy to be negative.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_421.wav|75|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_069.wav|2|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_171.wav|79|We can't go on like this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_012.wav|59|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_290.wav|67|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_333.wav|79|He has a point.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_292.wav|19|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_421.wav|72|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_260.wav|97|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_416.wav|56|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_354.wav|2|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_121.wav|52|They have no real friends in the region.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_302.wav|28|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_035.wav|3|History is in the making.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_222.wav|19|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_283.wav|0|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_037.wav|35|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_195.wav|82|I never want to have any children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_057.wav|49|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_056.wav|94|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_236.wav|63|He must get to know himself.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_353.wav|5|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_077.wav|8|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_059.wav|32|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_086.wav|17|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_345.wav|13|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_337.wav|104|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_199.wav|12|I like footballers who play well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_384.wav|68|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_218.wav|23|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_133.wav|103|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_214.wav|15|It is a worry.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_370.wav|0|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_193.wav|75|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_251.wav|106|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_369.wav|35|They have broken the promise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_285.wav|14|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_166.wav|106|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_183.wav|80|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_438.wav|100|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_292.wav|2|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_288.wav|31|So I did.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_165.wav|53|But the game is still wide open.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_209.wav|72|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_279.wav|25|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_198.wav|1|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_109.wav|3|It is not affected by the sale.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_266.wav|27|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_090.wav|19|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_075.wav|5|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_363.wav|0|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_376.wav|65|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_329.wav|24|The takeover comes as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_110.wav|23|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_055.wav|37|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_312.wav|23|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_022.wav|103|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_378.wav|37|It was really quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_321.wav|38|I welcome this new service.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_202.wav|71|"It was worth a photograph."
DUMMY2/p363/p363_278.wav|6|I have a problem with these things.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_237.wav|88|I am very encouraged by this poll.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_298.wav|85|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_371.wav|94|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_067.wav|11|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_015.wav|62|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_162.wav|35|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_320.wav|29|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_397.wav|94|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_031.wav|34|Its role is not to interfere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_503.wav|75|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_094.wav|36|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_180.wav|2|His name was unknown.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_266.wav|41|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_043.wav|57|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_005.wav|22|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_386.wav|96|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_249.wav|60|We have had our debate.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_137.wav|98|There is nothing like this back home.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_390.wav|65|It is the same with Barry.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_095.wav|43|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_065.wav|106|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_091.wav|22|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_022.wav|87|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_401.wav|24|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_311.wav|35|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_305.wav|65|Only one got through.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_128.wav|63|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_252.wav|36|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_166.wav|19|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_416.wav|13|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_152.wav|69|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_096.wav|3|I had a bit in hand.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_026.wav|58|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_175.wav|105|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_339.wav|48|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_378.wav|47|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_033.wav|47|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_180.wav|52|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_151.wav|7|His second goal was equally impressive.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_179.wav|55|I knew Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_287.wav|101|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_192.wav|83|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_413.wav|54|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_297.wav|5|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_028.wav|15|I feel really good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_301.wav|63|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_364.wav|31|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_358.wav|46|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_179.wav|51|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_136.wav|33|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_037.wav|43|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_295.wav|3|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_033.wav|54|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_273.wav|52|I think I was about four years old.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_180.wav|30|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_204.wav|26|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_324.wav|53|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_024.wav|87|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_076.wav|29|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_227.wav|70|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_087.wav|98|On that they agree.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_394.wav|4|They haven't run away.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_087.wav|50|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_377.wav|56|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_039.wav|68|We gave everything we had.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_310.wav|72|We understand the changes in the world.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_332.wav|58|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_258.wav|49|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_328.wav|105|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_235.wav|90|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_224.wav|89|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_110.wav|69|You should be.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_385.wav|76|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_274.wav|34|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_342.wav|97|They were average apart, together superb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_456.wav|50|They have to be met.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_309.wav|1|We all work for nothing.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_123.wav|63|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_377.wav|6|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_251.wav|42|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_188.wav|66|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_325.wav|62|This is complete nonsense.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_351.wav|97|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_196.wav|102|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_144.wav|103|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_084.wav|96|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_014.wav|0|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_217.wav|20|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_098.wav|95|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_065.wav|42|It's not only my respect for them.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_139.wav|54|They do the work, you know.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_214.wav|105|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_073.wav|12|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_188.wav|98|New Labour are running scared.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_172.wav|102|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_122.wav|14|However, the problem is timing.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_293.wav|99|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_314.wav|37|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_383.wav|50|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_065.wav|64|This is only the start of my season.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_148.wav|94|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_026.wav|50|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_125.wav|31|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_061.wav|93|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_421.wav|49|But who gets on the tube?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_255.wav|63|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_288.wav|0|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_336.wav|38|So just what is her enduring appeal?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_019.wav|62|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_081.wav|4|You just have to adjust.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_042.wav|97|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_258.wav|76|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_381.wav|82|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_262.wav|28|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_299.wav|84|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_091.wav|97|We could not compete with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_291.wav|39|I was first in the door.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_320.wav|0|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_406.wav|20|They were kept there for a summer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_206.wav|16|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_232.wav|30|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_166.wav|102|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_003.wav|107|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_386.wav|21|They will have five minutes to decide.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_346.wav|48|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_365.wav|56|That is a crazy situation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_049.wav|92|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_353.wav|47|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_316.wav|99|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_238.wav|2|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_036.wav|53|Each brand was owned by a different family.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_230.wav|64|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_276.wav|23|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_095.wav|31|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_381.wav|26|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_226.wav|40|I will win.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_289.wav|41|The mood is good.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_210.wav|5|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_084.wav|39|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_264.wav|12|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_169.wav|79|Then there's the casting.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_300.wav|44|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_084.wav|77|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_056.wav|21|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_327.wav|51|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_279.wav|78|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_227.wav|10|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_058.wav|5|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_157.wav|50|He was right into football from an early age.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_306.wav|56|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_163.wav|2|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_385.wav|51|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_042.wav|83|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_390.wav|76|I may think about performing it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_283.wav|3|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_182.wav|49|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_277.wav|85|And he has a tale to tell.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_238.wav|66|We believe we have a strong case.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_079.wav|97|I played well but missed a few chances.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_333.wav|53|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_275.wav|21|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_230.wav|17|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_131.wav|14|They keep the atmosphere in mind.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_407.wav|17|It brings together two essential elements.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_164.wav|94|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_407.wav|97|Then there's one where people play for fun.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_310.wav|7|I understand the security issue.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_135.wav|28|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_430.wav|105|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_319.wav|47|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_314.wav|38|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_232.wav|73|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_344.wav|6|She would love it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_371.wav|103|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_425.wav|63|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_092.wav|91|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_249.wav|36|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_280.wav|38|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_346.wav|49|We have rebuilt and reformed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_501.wav|48|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_361.wav|45|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_145.wav|16|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_134.wav|102|There is still much work to be done.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_182.wav|98|This one was supposed to be so different.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_342.wav|7|This will save interest charges.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_358.wav|35|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_123.wav|80|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_233.wav|7|From there, they can go anywhere.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_373.wav|53|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_082.wav|34|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_280.wav|4|There are two ways to start a festival.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_306.wav|32|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_011.wav|67|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_306.wav|12|Their message was simple.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_257.wav|26|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_157.wav|66|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_203.wav|2|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_303.wav|73|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_176.wav|49|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_051.wav|87|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_224.wav|6|Among them is his beloved teacher.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_118.wav|1|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_202.wav|69|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_105.wav|55|It would be easy to think so.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_409.wav|37|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_327.wav|93|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_093.wav|47|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_095.wav|105|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_262.wav|26|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_109.wav|66|It was a bit of a struggle today.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_208.wav|35|This will take several weeks.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_141.wav|7|But she was very human.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_309.wav|75|I am a retailer by nature.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_402.wav|22|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_173.wav|90|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_318.wav|72|I don't understand it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_099.wav|86|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_313.wav|56|The pound has also suffered.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_196.wav|14|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_097.wav|61|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_207.wav|42|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_416.wav|95|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_111.wav|101|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_376.wav|15|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_300.wav|45|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_093.wav|103|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_160.wav|21|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_318.wav|42|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_087.wav|94|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p364/p364_030.wav|88|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_085.wav|56|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_267.wav|104|I would love to travel with it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_031.wav|89|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_280.wav|27|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_084.wav|88|I was close enough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_314.wav|55|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_193.wav|93|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_327.wav|26|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_378.wav|17|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_220.wav|57|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_213.wav|99|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_271.wav|25|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_085.wav|53|No plan for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_239.wav|47|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_299.wav|5|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_347.wav|64|For now, we must take one game at a time.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_129.wav|87|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_168.wav|75|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_384.wav|29|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_228.wav|94|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_062.wav|20|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_063.wav|70|It happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_415.wav|74|There are two interests in this woodland.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_097.wav|79|You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_132.wav|9|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_062.wav|72|They don't know how to do it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_322.wav|29|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_200.wav|84|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_119.wav|55|Its failure is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_292.wav|38|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_114.wav|22|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_075.wav|33|It was a pretty terrible day.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_357.wav|65|Neil knows the score.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_118.wav|14|The website has changed the company.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_099.wav|13|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_018.wav|81|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_060.wav|14|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_001.wav|27|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_427.wav|8|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_306.wav|85|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_166.wav|90|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_310.wav|15|That is my commitment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_332.wav|84|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_009.wav|42|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_128.wav|94|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_012.wav|5|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_369.wav|43|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_259.wav|94|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_385.wav|82|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_014.wav|66|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_032.wav|3|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_359.wav|20|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_360.wav|23|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_041.wav|26|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_036.wav|4|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_241.wav|20|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_162.wav|10|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_101.wav|60|It is not in the public interest.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_371.wav|98|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_241.wav|88|That is our business.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_226.wav|80|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_359.wav|53|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_214.wav|59|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_017.wav|63|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_011.wav|11|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_277.wav|99|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_407.wav|33|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_103.wav|92|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_236.wav|91|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_332.wav|48|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_009.wav|70|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_298.wav|12|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_181.wav|86|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_396.wav|49|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_323.wav|104|I wanted to drop out.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_226.wav|90|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_336.wav|63|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_244.wav|48|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_378.wav|85|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_218.wav|9|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_271.wav|46|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_406.wav|0|I thought he was an animal.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_051.wav|86|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_298.wav|54|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_172.wav|19|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_275.wav|96|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_296.wav|89|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_301.wav|73|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_032.wav|93|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_374.wav|95|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_208.wav|106|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_066.wav|10|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_311.wav|27|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_179.wav|85|Everything in the world was focused on London.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_274.wav|56|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_304.wav|8|It would be great to win the title again.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_366.wav|96|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_282.wav|93|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_171.wav|8|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_370.wav|24|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_004.wav|81|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_143.wav|5|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_335.wav|33|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_363.wav|36|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_367.wav|21|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_087.wav|16|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_242.wav|70|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_293.wav|16|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_001.wav|78|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_015.wav|38|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_399.wav|70|It might be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_465.wav|75|I was all image and no substance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_149.wav|51|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_108.wav|0|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_191.wav|96|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_153.wav|32|And sooner than we may think.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_293.wav|62|It would also take time.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_047.wav|28|What on earth is wrong with you?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_008.wav|98|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_043.wav|19|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_340.wav|26|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_318.wav|78|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_068.wav|38|It was a move which appealed to him.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_258.wav|67|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_124.wav|81|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_161.wav|7|We have to speed up the process.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_309.wav|90|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_257.wav|21|Horses are not affected.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_064.wav|12|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_351.wav|19|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_319.wav|18|It will not be easy for him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_229.wav|25|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_193.wav|4|I have done ever since it was published.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_060.wav|95|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_027.wav|9|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_283.wav|86|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_143.wav|32|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_084.wav|68|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_406.wav|60|Still, it is a very good result for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_165.wav|93|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_057.wav|69|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_186.wav|50|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_386.wav|107|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_379.wav|29|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_213.wav|51|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_057.wav|95|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_370.wav|51|This means a great deal to the families.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_190.wav|20|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_110.wav|80|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_286.wav|42|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_193.wav|28|This is still a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_115.wav|104|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_372.wav|75|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_101.wav|18|Six men will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_119.wav|59|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_098.wav|0|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_143.wav|6|Maybe it will work there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_215.wav|17|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_441.wav|63|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_080.wav|26|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_408.wav|75|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_336.wav|29|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_023.wav|36|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_294.wav|57|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_410.wav|33|Everyone has his share of trouble.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_187.wav|74|This was an option from the beginning.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_085.wav|42|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_379.wav|34|I'll have to work on that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_373.wav|8|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_059.wav|40|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_269.wav|102|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_335.wav|22|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_034.wav|95|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_015.wav|68|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_201.wav|105|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_043.wav|106|I might well have done so already.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_049.wav|69|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_229.wav|30|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_082.wav|33|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_009.wav|76|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_148.wav|30|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_328.wav|26|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_122.wav|51|But the killer remains at large.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_435.wav|7|I watch the other visitors.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_134.wav|14|But it could be a consequence of our policy.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_312.wav|105|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_004.wav|75|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_039.wav|80|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_037.wav|60|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_118.wav|54|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_461.wav|24|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_349.wav|18|We're very close to being a good team.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_267.wav|91|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_330.wav|87|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_019.wav|25|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_083.wav|34|These things just happen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_216.wav|72|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_103.wav|11|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_166.wav|4|Two options are being proposed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_219.wav|22|What are you not good at?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_267.wav|43|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_021.wav|36|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_135.wav|93|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_167.wav|25|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_353.wav|50|The units will not be replaced.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_081.wav|13|I can't believe she is dead.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_314.wav|44|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_054.wav|21|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_353.wav|55|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_204.wav|20|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_078.wav|54|This has not, and has been neglected.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_282.wav|6|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_154.wav|83|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_264.wav|86|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_281.wav|1|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_229.wav|102|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_168.wav|9|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_110.wav|97|It is a potential factor.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_105.wav|22|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_320.wav|78|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_260.wav|75|It is very hard for her.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_377.wav|13|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_210.wav|68|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_289.wav|101|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_262.wav|80|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_060.wav|71|"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_168.wav|32|It's not good at all.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_172.wav|26|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_097.wav|104|In fact, they go hand in hand.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_400.wav|79|She had denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_160.wav|53|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_059.wav|81|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_080.wav|40|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_425.wav|89|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_315.wav|103|There is no threat to them.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_353.wav|24|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_179.wav|78|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_445.wav|32|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_149.wav|20|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_186.wav|10|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_062.wav|21|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_104.wav|93|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_138.wav|6|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_188.wav|21|It was good today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_118.wav|95|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_172.wav|61|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_385.wav|14|to have products for their needs.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_173.wav|16|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_440.wav|100|It will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_384.wav|102|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_029.wav|9|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_091.wav|69|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p363/p363_363.wav|6|It was great fun.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_241.wav|62|Partly, it is his own fault.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_420.wav|89|There's been a mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_261.wav|89|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_197.wav|76|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_266.wav|38|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_263.wav|6|He was travelling to see his daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_183.wav|29|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_380.wav|26|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_383.wav|6|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_189.wav|79|Now he is back on top again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_194.wav|0|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_399.wav|42|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_222.wav|56|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_341.wav|103|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_248.wav|93|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_100.wav|8|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_089.wav|100|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_109.wav|28|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_015.wav|90|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_094.wav|21|It is par for the course, of course.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_198.wav|44|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_334.wav|43|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_288.wav|8|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_110.wav|76|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_137.wav|23|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_183.wav|10|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_406.wav|66|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_149.wav|106|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_162.wav|86|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_179.wav|25|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_027.wav|96|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_020.wav|105|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_123.wav|103|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_243.wav|80|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_276.wav|63|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_128.wav|44|A lot of people were in tears.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_394.wav|14|Theatre is not a museum.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_340.wav|38|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_314.wav|54|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_184.wav|62|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_041.wav|25|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_301.wav|18|It turned out to have been three hours.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_118.wav|74|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_126.wav|41|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_015.wav|64|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_042.wav|21|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_462.wav|32|Driving has been the key.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_168.wav|25|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_010.wav|50|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_058.wav|90|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_412.wav|69|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_148.wav|86|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_192.wav|106|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_190.wav|66|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_280.wav|90|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_287.wav|75|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_195.wav|1|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_153.wav|106|And they all have a vote.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_279.wav|9|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_312.wav|45|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_174.wav|105|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_221.wav|39|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_218.wav|4|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_130.wav|7|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_385.wav|60|I didn't do it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_224.wav|23|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_236.wav|24|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_093.wav|59|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_132.wav|29|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_396.wav|100|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_196.wav|98|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_022.wav|104|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_300.wav|42|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_041.wav|73|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_032.wav|26|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_386.wav|67|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_178.wav|12|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_195.wav|97|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_350.wav|5|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_028.wav|77|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_155.wav|1|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_097.wav|97|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_235.wav|61|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_202.wav|21|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_339.wav|22|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_141.wav|102|That's because we work hard at it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_260.wav|106|They've got some extremely good players.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_227.wav|17|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_411.wav|105|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_390.wav|87|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_275.wav|40|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_251.wav|27|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_352.wav|8|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_154.wav|31|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_018.wav|1|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_236.wav|21|Men should avoid it like the plague.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_418.wav|11|And well he might.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_446.wav|7|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_069.wav|13|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_410.wav|55|All the dead were believed to have been French.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_100.wav|35|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_028.wav|90|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_420.wav|54|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_190.wav|39|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_260.wav|36|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_051.wav|12|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_308.wav|60|We are not physical at all.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_072.wav|10|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_031.wav|74|He was very close.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_165.wav|6|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_067.wav|89|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_140.wav|44|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_338.wav|82|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_225.wav|68|It did my image a lot of good!
DUMMY2/p341/p341_216.wav|66|It didn't get any better.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_164.wav|7|Nothing was meant by it.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_295.wav|103|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_088.wav|6|It has come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_322.wav|19|But will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_402.wav|91|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_341.wav|22|I am not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_298.wav|72|We come here in peace, for peace.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_076.wav|5|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_238.wav|105|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_061.wav|63|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_414.wav|33|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_109.wav|98|I want to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_044.wav|16|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_280.wav|0|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_407.wav|87|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_010.wav|30|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_342.wav|104|She is an imposing presence.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_088.wav|36|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_340.wav|42|This is the start of a slippery slope.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_272.wav|105|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_066.wav|105|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_184.wav|53|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_097.wav|16|I am extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_422.wav|19|Now, that is a good deal.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_202.wav|96|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_142.wav|28|I'm the one that said it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_197.wav|75|That is a waste of energy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_271.wav|34|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_268.wav|80|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_223.wav|23|We never got off the bus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_094.wav|2|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_074.wav|37|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_340.wav|86|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_060.wav|64|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_340.wav|56|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_118.wav|29|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_413.wav|38|The hangover was Olympian.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_385.wav|39|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_164.wav|48|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_416.wav|54|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_086.wav|15|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_418.wav|1|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_362.wav|76|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_424.wav|27|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_299.wav|26|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_185.wav|99|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_294.wav|90|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_106.wav|88|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_096.wav|96|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_437.wav|89|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_187.wav|65|I remember that day well.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_048.wav|28|We will continue to pressure the Government.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_444.wav|37|I believe we can handle this okay.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_112.wav|78|But he has not become a monster.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_243.wav|32|I was released after six days.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_010.wav|14|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p292/p292_108.wav|13|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_094.wav|97|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_234.wav|8|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_087.wav|0|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_073.wav|104|Two things were clear from the new programme.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_112.wav|91|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_426.wav|37|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_163.wav|29|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_373.wav|42|It's like English in its underwear.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_107.wav|60|That would be even more disastrous.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_087.wav|7|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_086.wav|94|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_302.wav|46|I think it is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_392.wav|62|It's the whole season.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_211.wav|46|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_130.wav|78|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_295.wav|29|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_348.wav|104|The result could be all down to turnout.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_040.wav|3|We are the party of the future.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_088.wav|29|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_353.wav|60|This is a moment to seize.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_229.wav|59|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_370.wav|102|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_143.wav|55|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_031.wav|40|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_092.wav|48|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_346.wav|34|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_177.wav|15|He is a master of deceit and delay.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_412.wav|105|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_302.wav|14|I wanted to change the formula.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_158.wav|87|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_074.wav|58|The settlement could run to millions.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_209.wav|83|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_136.wav|81|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_208.wav|55|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_013.wav|73|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_332.wav|101|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_224.wav|39|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_116.wav|100|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_269.wav|1|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_150.wav|0|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_174.wav|35|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_184.wav|51|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_042.wav|74|This is great news.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_335.wav|82|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_238.wav|97|He did not report it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_006.wav|14|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p351/p351_152.wav|33|There is nothing they can't do.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_244.wav|76|This was done by the council staff.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_386.wav|79|It could have been prevented.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_044.wav|85|The question is, Will it be enough?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_364.wav|84|They received a reply from their own managers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_079.wav|71|"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night."
DUMMY2/p238/p238_085.wav|37|It is somewhere to be.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_192.wav|72|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_143.wav|74|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_301.wav|80|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_370.wav|2|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_355.wav|96|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_153.wav|85|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_131.wav|47|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_001.wav|15|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_219.wav|37|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_144.wav|99|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_089.wav|1|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_039.wav|4|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_412.wav|13|They would not tell us.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_327.wav|80|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_012.wav|72|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_371.wav|82|I couldn't put my finger on it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_056.wav|16|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_134.wav|72|The Lobby is not failing.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_309.wav|44|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_024.wav|95|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_318.wav|96|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_084.wav|85|Weaknesses there are, however.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_381.wav|76|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_100.wav|16|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_305.wav|105|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_239.wav|79|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_094.wav|24|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_107.wav|78|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_273.wav|38|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_263.wav|31|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_398.wav|65|It was an attitude thing.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_264.wav|48|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_368.wav|98|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_465.wav|65|He enjoyed being with his family.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_345.wav|38|She wondered why we were interested.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_141.wav|48|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_068.wav|46|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_070.wav|15|Allison is not convinced.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_248.wav|10|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_343.wav|106|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_254.wav|30|We are at a crossroads.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_267.wav|73|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_090.wav|79|I was saying, No.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_009.wav|19|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_423.wav|15|Or, rather, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_165.wav|51|I should not be able to stand.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_170.wav|102|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_045.wav|100|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_321.wav|16|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_261.wav|17|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p295/p295_259.wav|92|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_407.wav|26|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_252.wav|23|That's why he plays for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_386.wav|8|She is obviously very disappointed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_023.wav|98|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_393.wav|7|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_086.wav|42|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_147.wav|55|I am never fully fit.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_292.wav|55|His season started this afternoon.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_366.wav|18|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_396.wav|51|We can make changes.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_250.wav|13|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_071.wav|25|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_241.wav|71|"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken."
DUMMY2/p241/p241_157.wav|86|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_093.wav|80|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_071.wav|93|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_235.wav|46|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_238.wav|33|He is doing the right things.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_145.wav|13|I have a great respect for her.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_271.wav|26|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_165.wav|18|How can they say that?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_151.wav|78|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_219.wav|54|Then there's one where people play for fun.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_248.wav|26|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_244.wav|84|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_041.wav|98|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_074.wav|34|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_302.wav|65|It changed the very language.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_169.wav|84|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_216.wav|82|And we will do it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_248.wav|89|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_332.wav|95|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_092.wav|81|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_365.wav|58|I don't have a new house.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_044.wav|78|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_117.wav|45|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_046.wav|73|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_288.wav|93|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_076.wav|50|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_041.wav|51|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_145.wav|39|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_426.wav|27|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_007.wav|89|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_269.wav|49|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_250.wav|23|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_173.wav|27|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_111.wav|17|There are lots of these women in Finland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_334.wav|16|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_236.wav|27|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_126.wav|106|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_116.wav|82|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_226.wav|3|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_203.wav|104|We now have a moment of hope.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_049.wav|48|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_041.wav|57|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_303.wav|63|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_308.wav|99|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_076.wav|15|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_217.wav|64|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_313.wav|98|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_192.wav|9|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_087.wav|1|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_298.wav|55|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_315.wav|30|It's like the Russians.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_355.wav|72|The truth, of course, is very different.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_192.wav|50|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_098.wav|14|He had missed a penalty against the English.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_205.wav|98|It's part of the end game.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_210.wav|13|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_356.wav|23|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_416.wav|103|Yet it is all for two good causes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_049.wav|84|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_063.wav|12|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_002.wav|98|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_236.wav|22|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_009.wav|14|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
DUMMY2/p272/p272_295.wav|69|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_189.wav|98|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_053.wav|16|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_061.wav|38|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_223.wav|20|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_048.wav|65|There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_179.wav|30|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_060.wav|13|There are two interests in this woodland.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_269.wav|84|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_371.wav|91|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_285.wav|3|Do you think we're a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_470.wav|32|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_196.wav|51|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_291.wav|2|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_259.wav|31|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_255.wav|97|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_277.wav|16|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_328.wav|23|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_419.wav|95|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_036.wav|49|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_277.wav|84|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_431.wav|24|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_206.wav|51|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_179.wav|36|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_412.wav|85|I have signed a contract.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_096.wav|34|There is no conflict of interest.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_017.wav|55|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_015.wav|15|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_421.wav|13|He was back to square one.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_100.wav|54|They never looked like winning it either.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_013.wav|46|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_304.wav|92|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_269.wav|38|I would recommend it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_114.wav|47|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_287.wav|32|It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_096.wav|70|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_262.wav|67|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_044.wav|19|We have not had a formal request.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_056.wav|30|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_143.wav|38|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_363.wav|107|It's not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_203.wav|81|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_206.wav|5|I have decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_267.wav|9|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_441.wav|75|The damage is all inside.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_312.wav|82|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_117.wav|83|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_281.wav|8|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_182.wav|93|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_318.wav|66|Farmers have been an endangered species.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_301.wav|74|There is a lot of fear.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_156.wav|16|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_260.wav|52|And they never show the same film as a rival.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_195.wav|76|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_199.wav|5|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_115.wav|42|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_003.wav|56|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_101.wav|65|Two of our crew were killed.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_189.wav|14|They bought the property four years ago.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_073.wav|61|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_042.wav|14|They said she was stable.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_016.wav|22|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_119.wav|46|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_020.wav|33|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_303.wav|82|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_417.wav|105|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_288.wav|105|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_253.wav|106|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_308.wav|37|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_313.wav|59|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_343.wav|55|We are a husband and wife team.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_030.wav|46|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_148.wav|20|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_279.wav|23|That, however, is only part of their story.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_363.wav|16|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_116.wav|102|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_015.wav|94|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_006.wav|61|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_051.wav|55|She continued to enjoy sport.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_229.wav|31|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_326.wav|9|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_157.wav|59|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_012.wav|65|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p360/p360_412.wav|60|I thought they played well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_060.wav|76|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_073.wav|27|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_412.wav|24|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_260.wav|18|It was an amazing experience.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_085.wav|92|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_137.wav|96|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_107.wav|4|Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_264.wav|74|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_066.wav|64|It sounded awfully like panic.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_109.wav|40|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_264.wav|6|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_157.wav|32|They should stop the bombing.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_372.wav|48|That took about two years.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_397.wav|69|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_224.wav|49|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_324.wav|65|They really had a go at us.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_025.wav|60|You can never take a win for granted.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_076.wav|47|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_291.wav|14|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_048.wav|7|They had to explain it.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_072.wav|20|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_293.wav|13|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_206.wav|46|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_065.wav|58|He takes time out for everyone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_055.wav|73|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_292.wav|18|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_333.wav|31|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_378.wav|97|We talk to each other about these matters.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_303.wav|97|It is like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_065.wav|37|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_209.wav|15|I have no secrets.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_112.wav|65|This makes up for it.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_176.wav|26|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_195.wav|31|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_100.wav|21|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_038.wav|57|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_101.wav|9|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_136.wav|23|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_166.wav|15|So, easy does it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_265.wav|107|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_040.wav|92|Our children are the future of our society.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_126.wav|49|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_309.wav|67|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_014.wav|60|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_286.wav|13|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_299.wav|91|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_125.wav|103|More patience and composure was required.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_071.wav|75|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_318.wav|27|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_035.wav|17|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_327.wav|42|You will never replace the child.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_322.wav|107|They are there to get people into work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_212.wav|66|I asked why he had come.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_410.wav|72|They are not a set of options.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_068.wav|39|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_176.wav|90|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_198.wav|61|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_093.wav|81|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_163.wav|79|That comes at a cost.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_246.wav|86|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_037.wav|10|It was a hell of a way to lose.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_145.wav|86|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_089.wav|30|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_241.wav|12|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_280.wav|1|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_336.wav|55|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_085.wav|0|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_298.wav|86|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_189.wav|13|It is a very sad day.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_138.wav|72|How many cases have there been?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_202.wav|24|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_321.wav|24|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_168.wav|1|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_366.wav|23|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_147.wav|57|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_412.wav|95|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_047.wav|18|The jury is still out on this one.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_027.wav|37|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_366.wav|41|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_293.wav|68|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_179.wav|26|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_321.wav|4|This was another video cassette.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_244.wav|85|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_020.wav|59|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_363.wav|25|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_148.wav|67|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_227.wav|62|It made me determined to get back.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_196.wav|42|I was just doing my job.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_207.wav|7|He should emerge as the winner.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_156.wav|19|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_276.wav|99|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_108.wav|63|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_092.wav|72|It was one he was born to play.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_408.wav|49|There is no going back.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_167.wav|86|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_220.wav|60|I was pleased about that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_361.wav|41|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_208.wav|102|We were on top and could've won.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_227.wav|98|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_044.wav|100|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_020.wav|13|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_170.wav|69|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_337.wav|96|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_342.wav|16|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_247.wav|53|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_327.wav|16|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_237.wav|67|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_407.wav|63|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_203.wav|91|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_342.wav|34|Everyone thought they were safe.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_312.wav|40|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_332.wav|104|The need for further investment is obvious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_023.wav|60|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_358.wav|52|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_343.wav|20|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_228.wav|107|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_359.wav|103|Pray that it is so.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_270.wav|73|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_287.wav|1|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_043.wav|100|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_232.wav|86|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_058.wav|106|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_436.wav|14|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_398.wav|87|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_274.wav|7|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_338.wav|50|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_260.wav|95|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_289.wav|95|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_240.wav|83|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_091.wav|51|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_084.wav|40|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_122.wav|17|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_131.wav|67|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_285.wav|46|Working with him is like working with myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_217.wav|89|But she was.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_276.wav|51|Intensive care has been very busy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_019.wav|98|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_101.wav|105|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_149.wav|62|I am so, so, so lucky.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_010.wav|17|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_141.wav|31|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_337.wav|50|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_024.wav|56|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_048.wav|15|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_387.wav|107|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_143.wav|87|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_402.wav|77|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_079.wav|93|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_210.wav|34|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_360.wav|43|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_272.wav|38|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_260.wav|61|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_237.wav|2|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_148.wav|96|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_277.wav|0|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_174.wav|10|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_086.wav|80|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_379.wav|55|That could be ready within another nine months.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_143.wav|92|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_304.wav|50|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_309.wav|91|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_129.wav|75|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_377.wav|39|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_414.wav|85|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_112.wav|14|Athletics is on a roll in the country.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_280.wav|98|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_348.wav|45|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_263.wav|79|Do something that we need.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_085.wav|59|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_312.wav|29|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_146.wav|33|Mr Smith was dismissive.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_428.wav|32|It needs to be volatile.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_184.wav|73|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_248.wav|20|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_298.wav|51|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_023.wav|10|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_183.wav|90|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_158.wav|72|There are plenty examples.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_355.wav|89|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_454.wav|39|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_032.wav|35|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_023.wav|84|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_380.wav|42|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_189.wav|12|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_095.wav|72|I am about protecting the state pension.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_126.wav|98|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_281.wav|79|I am really sorry that he is going.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_224.wav|13|No means testing will be required.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_211.wav|99|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_252.wav|85|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_032.wav|22|The punishment was swift.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_139.wav|106|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_333.wav|49|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_049.wav|70|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_017.wav|60|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_034.wav|29|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_203.wav|27|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_039.wav|37|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_059.wav|61|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_293.wav|8|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_360.wav|63|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_316.wav|64|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_158.wav|57|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_370.wav|95|There is a range of employers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_156.wav|57|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_101.wav|76|This is my personal assessment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_070.wav|89|They are real.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_030.wav|92|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_150.wav|18|Mind you, all was not lost.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_236.wav|20|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_017.wav|33|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_092.wav|4|I am relishing the challenge.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_067.wav|3|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_076.wav|84|We can all make a mistake.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_194.wav|68|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_336.wav|69|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_107.wav|95|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_346.wav|10|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_025.wav|14|They are very clever in their use of words.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_202.wav|36|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_321.wav|75|All winners should be tested.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_072.wav|73|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_060.wav|97|The problem is the book.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_048.wav|73|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_407.wav|103|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_095.wav|69|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_154.wav|70|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_347.wav|9|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_357.wav|41|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_182.wav|20|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_266.wav|50|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_189.wav|72|The cost of war is more than that.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_362.wav|7|A Home Office spokesman said.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_141.wav|70|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_386.wav|70|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_077.wav|100|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_283.wav|23|The whole process was so different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_028.wav|38|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_351.wav|38|We took the chances when they came.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_201.wav|99|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_083.wav|3|They were badly prepared for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_366.wav|70|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_297.wav|41|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_375.wav|100|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_066.wav|79|But we are very near.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_262.wav|103|I have no argument with Scotland.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_439.wav|27|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_305.wav|103|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_186.wav|99|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_301.wav|3|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_292.wav|20|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_104.wav|10|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_293.wav|11|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_294.wav|29|But the plot is not the point.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_104.wav|4|But things are never the same again.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_373.wav|31|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_055.wav|19|Her role in it was small.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_033.wav|98|We are proud of them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_013.wav|29|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_173.wav|0|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_307.wav|2|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_199.wav|2|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_054.wav|13|I'm trying not to think about that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_245.wav|4|Everyone must be focused on the league.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_026.wav|84|But we will have to wait.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_012.wav|49|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_127.wav|30|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_186.wav|86|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_332.wav|83|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_050.wav|64|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_126.wav|87|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_287.wav|90|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_400.wav|27|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_001.wav|66|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_397.wav|96|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_381.wav|64|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_356.wav|0|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_394.wav|49|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_275.wav|51|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_271.wav|79|It's not the tour.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_077.wav|4|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_030.wav|93|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_035.wav|57|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_070.wav|12|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_354.wav|64|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_145.wav|38|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_175.wav|106|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_223.wav|29|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_400.wav|10|There's still no-one like him.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_398.wav|76|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_224.wav|86|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_290.wav|21|The princess has had other health problems.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_072.wav|83|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_196.wav|93|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_310.wav|31|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_436.wav|7|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_357.wav|31|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_107.wav|64|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_373.wav|29|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_327.wav|38|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_191.wav|74|We haven't been able to go and see.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_315.wav|68|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_369.wav|87|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_196.wav|71|"Is that success?"
DUMMY2/p256/p256_086.wav|90|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_133.wav|30|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_361.wav|1|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_173.wav|21|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_103.wav|99|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_057.wav|8|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_305.wav|14|Tony Blair said as little.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_061.wav|0|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_416.wav|36|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_181.wav|5|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_021.wav|44|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_117.wav|12|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_361.wav|23|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_144.wav|65|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_133.wav|105|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_323.wav|43|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_122.wav|53|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_040.wav|48|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_349.wav|98|People want to learn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_417.wav|56|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_068.wav|22|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_131.wav|72|No other offers apply.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_108.wav|106|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_060.wav|90|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_162.wav|56|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_389.wav|77|It gets into the culture.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_362.wav|75|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_177.wav|35|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_421.wav|7|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_156.wav|97|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_105.wav|3|He has become a monster.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_158.wav|62|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_050.wav|13|What is the new religion?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_179.wav|18|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_042.wav|61|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_246.wav|58|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_096.wav|21|The winner will be announced next month.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_002.wav|58|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_056.wav|53|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_316.wav|98|This is an appealing record.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_023.wav|58|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_185.wav|18|From day one, we were a family.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_365.wav|17|Their mind was already made up.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_279.wav|68|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_085.wav|20|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p277/p277_060.wav|89|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_256.wav|28|My game just seems to keep on improving.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_127.wav|69|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_124.wav|38|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_008.wav|73|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_224.wav|0|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_061.wav|90|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_156.wav|6|We have been extremely busy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_300.wav|37|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_201.wav|58|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_473.wav|7|I'm very passionate about my country.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_052.wav|105|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_109.wav|105|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_382.wav|6|It is something that we would support.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_359.wav|17|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_086.wav|19|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_194.wav|72|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_171.wav|47|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_289.wav|8|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_235.wav|52|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_235.wav|106|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_085.wav|86|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p228/p228_157.wav|57|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_080.wav|29|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_036.wav|15|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_008.wav|63|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_401.wav|22|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_352.wav|80|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_198.wav|105|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_368.wav|22|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_031.wav|83|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_214.wav|6|This is not a monument to the past.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_409.wav|89|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_328.wav|6|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_253.wav|55|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_141.wav|43|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_401.wav|91|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_001.wav|107|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_141.wav|50|I miss the freedom that I had.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_143.wav|29|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_027.wav|55|It would fit very well with us.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_200.wav|10|They are still very quiet.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_194.wav|8|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_393.wav|97|She kept him on a string.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_367.wav|54|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_368.wav|34|There are simply no orders.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_213.wav|72|It was total confusion.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_224.wav|58|But the row refused to go away.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_294.wav|47|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_165.wav|50|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_053.wav|104|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_342.wav|103|There is great interest on our island.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_254.wav|41|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_083.wav|77|It was not an insult.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_297.wav|54|This is a very positive step forward.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_245.wav|15|The most important thing is the game.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_179.wav|106|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_018.wav|97|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_094.wav|33|The matter is under discussion.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_218.wav|20|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_035.wav|90|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_049.wav|25|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_253.wav|86|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_011.wav|94|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_073.wav|29|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_345.wav|2|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_247.wav|75|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_354.wav|14|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_175.wav|19|It was that kind of night.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_309.wav|15|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_058.wav|48|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_012.wav|19|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_400.wav|18|It's not just going to be busy.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_292.wav|21|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_395.wav|106|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_289.wav|18|I think we could do well in Europe.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_181.wav|45|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_213.wav|103|We did not talk about it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_089.wav|50|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_224.wav|50|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_082.wav|45|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_224.wav|80|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_204.wav|31|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_151.wav|55|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_327.wav|1|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_217.wav|92|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_256.wav|2|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_067.wav|61|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_350.wav|51|This seems like a very good idea.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_233.wav|69|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_010.wav|27|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_324.wav|44|I'll go out and be aggressive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_017.wav|94|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_171.wav|46|British officials said they could not say.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_187.wav|87|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_215.wav|53|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_158.wav|42|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_001.wav|87|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_280.wav|62|All were within range of Israeli cities.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_103.wav|95|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_125.wav|66|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_294.wav|101|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_160.wav|86|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_034.wav|13|It was a deceit.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_064.wav|97|They say he wants to go to England.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_033.wav|16|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_163.wav|8|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_181.wav|104|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_053.wav|72|Are you listening, All Saints?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_340.wav|78|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_018.wav|41|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_398.wav|104|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_158.wav|100|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_181.wav|38|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_366.wav|103|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_019.wav|55|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_382.wav|28|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_324.wav|47|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_160.wav|95|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_403.wav|41|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_429.wav|89|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_018.wav|9|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_366.wav|8|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_113.wav|25|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_297.wav|2|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_382.wav|89|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_076.wav|107|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_291.wav|8|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_073.wav|84|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_271.wav|44|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_260.wav|53|And they never show the same film as a rival.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_093.wav|107|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_015.wav|31|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_266.wav|40|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_241.wav|60|It is all very upbeat.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_152.wav|107|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_048.wav|10|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_067.wav|69|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_176.wav|63|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_031.wav|36|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_411.wav|77|It certainly appeared that way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_270.wav|51|I'm not talking about his career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_270.wav|77|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_170.wav|17|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_470.wav|75|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_381.wav|58|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_177.wav|61|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_175.wav|81|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_011.wav|8|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_238.wav|39|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_382.wav|66|We have been working together for some years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_108.wav|95|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_045.wav|53|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_197.wav|19|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_289.wav|48|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p345/p345_104.wav|82|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_285.wav|31|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_259.wav|102|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_163.wav|25|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_108.wav|103|It may be argued.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_054.wav|53|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_290.wav|2|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_012.wav|91|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_394.wav|38|He sat down at the piano.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_372.wav|24|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_365.wav|48|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_027.wav|102|It is not an amnesty.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_255.wav|80|It is very important that we get the balance right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_161.wav|93|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_374.wav|1|He wouldn't do it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_223.wav|58|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_278.wav|15|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_417.wav|62|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_290.wav|50|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_270.wav|1|That is our main aim.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_321.wav|27|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_303.wav|70|You should be.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_355.wav|37|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_396.wav|56|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_121.wav|102|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_113.wav|42|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_302.wav|61|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_229.wav|36|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_421.wav|92|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_057.wav|42|From our point of view, it's the right time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_398.wav|60|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_021.wav|63|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_113.wav|7|He was jailed for a year.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_309.wav|29|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_380.wav|87|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_253.wav|72|He wouldn't have played in all three.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_403.wav|22|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_183.wav|24|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_170.wav|56|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_402.wav|95|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_225.wav|61|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_420.wav|104|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_105.wav|106|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_101.wav|11|That was very important.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_128.wav|91|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_034.wav|88|The man has already had too many chances.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_430.wav|39|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_271.wav|95|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_167.wav|24|People were actually not on his side.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_232.wav|11|We need to think.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_155.wav|51|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_375.wav|104|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_190.wav|94|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_389.wav|75|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_329.wav|78|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_014.wav|37|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_036.wav|57|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_331.wav|51|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_015.wav|52|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_048.wav|103|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_108.wav|93|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_297.wav|75|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_025.wav|94|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_158.wav|39|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_191.wav|57|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_384.wav|7|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_204.wav|103|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_052.wav|103|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_229.wav|61|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_480.wav|75|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_403.wav|7|It would be quite nice.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_361.wav|102|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_287.wav|105|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_374.wav|79|This is good news for the industry.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_346.wav|32|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_055.wav|46|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_220.wav|50|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_203.wav|8|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_247.wav|19|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_053.wav|87|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_173.wav|48|She is in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_293.wav|1|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_267.wav|11|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_206.wav|56|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_059.wav|106|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_128.wav|62|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_273.wav|76|There is no more money.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_410.wav|51|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_217.wav|14|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_149.wav|21|But when we do it it is great.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_234.wav|98|It may not be life long.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_030.wav|91|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_286.wav|102|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_444.wav|63|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_085.wav|23|There are plenty examples.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_110.wav|2|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_219.wav|43|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_053.wav|8|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_029.wav|39|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_162.wav|47|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_041.wav|95|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_114.wav|20|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_046.wav|89|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_219.wav|99|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_020.wav|72|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_017.wav|84|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_075.wav|66|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_022.wav|46|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_184.wav|56|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_342.wav|44|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_190.wav|19|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_216.wav|91|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_205.wav|29|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_383.wav|49|There is a job to be done.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_399.wav|34|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_295.wav|76|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_322.wav|98|No person has been charged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_382.wav|23|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_268.wav|49|I have good memories of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_055.wav|70|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_045.wav|105|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_079.wav|19|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_017.wav|1|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_036.wav|101|It was a close call.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_169.wav|17|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_170.wav|103|There was even a joke.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_120.wav|6|It would be really interesting if they did.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_025.wav|40|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_002.wav|103|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_288.wav|40|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p317/p317_076.wav|97|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_414.wav|8|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_304.wav|87|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_098.wav|76|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_258.wav|22|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_414.wav|13|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_252.wav|79|Colour is another problem.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_112.wav|59|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_111.wav|107|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_268.wav|72|We then went to see the headmaster.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_168.wav|33|Well, what can you do?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_194.wav|51|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_403.wav|95|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_379.wav|56|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_354.wav|3|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_081.wav|56|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_315.wav|59|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_367.wav|15|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_054.wav|85|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_368.wav|79|It is really special to me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_006.wav|32|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p231/p231_438.wav|50|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_204.wav|11|It was so unfair.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_300.wav|30|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_142.wav|100|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_217.wav|49|This doesn't have to be our future.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_236.wav|60|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_315.wav|39|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_224.wav|42|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_384.wav|38|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_159.wav|94|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_239.wav|32|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_156.wav|77|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_253.wav|59|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_260.wav|47|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_217.wav|8|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_317.wav|63|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_139.wav|97|We can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_051.wav|48|New York is my home.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_042.wav|5|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_127.wav|35|The opposite is the case.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_253.wav|33|Now the show is for public consumption.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_322.wav|99|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_270.wav|47|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_047.wav|31|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_158.wav|60|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_336.wav|42|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_253.wav|100|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_099.wav|5|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_407.wav|75|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_199.wav|62|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_298.wav|13|I wonder if Rangers do that?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_255.wav|25|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_298.wav|84|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_326.wav|6|This is an awful lot of money.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_389.wav|0|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_323.wav|17|The result today is an impasse.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_329.wav|53|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_006.wav|80|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_324.wav|94|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_134.wav|54|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_264.wav|49|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_259.wav|65|We were looking for a base.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_062.wav|47|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_247.wav|7|We will reform the welfare state.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_207.wav|77|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_029.wav|63|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_090.wav|93|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_215.wav|20|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_340.wav|2|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_057.wav|6|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_315.wav|53|If you believe in the blue and white.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_368.wav|14|I think we'll just keep it.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_412.wav|104|It was not known to myself.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_270.wav|17|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_327.wav|100|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_424.wav|37|Got to get my sunglasses.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_157.wav|20|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_284.wav|39|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_282.wav|101|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_263.wav|105|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_187.wav|45|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_260.wav|44|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_287.wav|98|I had no experience at all.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_346.wav|18|So what was he really doing?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_038.wav|30|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_352.wav|0|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_046.wav|62|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_241.wav|55|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_049.wav|76|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_437.wav|7|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_226.wav|6|That in itself is a joke.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_181.wav|77|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_213.wav|46|Or some thought that they have.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_393.wav|55|There's nothing natural left.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_053.wav|95|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_140.wav|2|I was awful.

DUMMY2/p360/p360_414.wav|60|And they went on to win the title.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_024.wav|41|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_091.wav|66|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_322.wav|42|I was pregnant and very worried.

DUMMY2/p306/p306_250.wav|12|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_012.wav|17|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_241.wav|64|That is the key message.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_374.wav|8|They knew that I wanted to do something.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_286.wav|105|The home was now under new management.

DUMMY2/p295/p295_155.wav|92|I'm sure they will be very happy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_042.wav|47|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_234.wav|5|You should be.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_216.wav|84|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.

DUMMY2/p300/p300_244.wav|102|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_393.wav|105|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_263.wav|76|It's up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_005.wav|89|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_260.wav|68|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_117.wav|75|But his attendance is not guaranteed.

DUMMY2/p276/p276_184.wav|106|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_351.wav|76|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_361.wav|60|That would be very good for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_104.wav|52|They won't actually make any money from it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_086.wav|66|You can't keep them separate.

DUMMY2/p333/p333_285.wav|64|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_174.wav|61|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.

DUMMY2/p336/p336_235.wav|98|Everyone was in tears.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_025.wav|16|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_406.wav|63|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_176.wav|21|He will want to utilise the midfield.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_068.wav|61|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_293.wav|21|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_314.wav|97|Managers and clinicians must work together.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_236.wav|26|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_078.wav|22|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_361.wav|53|The institute board will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_072.wav|38|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_106.wav|79|I've done a lot in that building.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_393.wav|66|Story time is over - it's a war.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_085.wav|74|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_113.wav|55|It gets too much.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_097.wav|80|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_358.wav|82|This was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_378.wav|4|We have to start again on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_123.wav|98|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_097.wav|107|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_402.wav|36|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.

DUMMY2/p230/p230_181.wav|35|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_311.wav|81|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_360.wav|79|Seven people were critically injured.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_042.wav|50|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_155.wav|37|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_045.wav|79|He was found again almost a year later.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_352.wav|99|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_153.wav|31|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_296.wav|6|It will make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_017.wav|68|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_430.wav|8|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_178.wav|45|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_319.wav|15|The timing is obvious.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_292.wav|95|My office is down there.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_209.wav|43|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_378.wav|84|The mood was defiant.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_047.wav|94|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_108.wav|96|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_391.wav|85|But what will we put on it?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_087.wav|25|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_327.wav|3|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_026.wav|44|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_316.wav|105|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_380.wav|78|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_170.wav|95|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_005.wav|94|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_207.wav|51|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_299.wav|87|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_412.wav|22|But who gets on the tube?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_165.wav|69|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_005.wav|35|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_308.wav|33|I've played them all in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_102.wav|28|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_020.wav|90|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_183.wav|27|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_394.wav|100|I am a good player.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_244.wav|14|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_203.wav|39|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_158.wav|5|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_261.wav|56|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_098.wav|87|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_322.wav|57|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_228.wav|99|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_202.wav|61|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_119.wav|32|I was on a roll.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_021.wav|1|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_420.wav|63|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_271.wav|31|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_384.wav|103|It is a dilemma.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_151.wav|23|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_397.wav|87|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_169.wav|62|Who would be out there, singing?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_156.wav|99|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_158.wav|6|This is a big game for them.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_272.wav|103|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_318.wav|81|The show is at an end.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_017.wav|64|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_218.wav|7|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_365.wav|65|I would never even consider it.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_049.wav|62|Back then it was hard to refuse.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_471.wav|14|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_179.wav|43|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_271.wav|82|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_052.wav|29|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_196.wav|95|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_185.wav|26|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_360.wav|77|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_104.wav|90|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_373.wav|46|We're delighted about the vote.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_078.wav|59|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_401.wav|42|But every country has its own character.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_231.wav|77|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_390.wav|40|That set the tone.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_061.wav|3|You have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_024.wav|91|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_399.wav|19|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_284.wav|100|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_272.wav|107|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_090.wav|42|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_476.wav|24|I have always believed in myself.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_151.wav|76|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_274.wav|102|It does not move, which is amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_252.wav|3|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_274.wav|103|I'd never heard him in person before.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_026.wav|19|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_170.wav|33|They will be seen for years to come.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_035.wav|1|There were no reported injuries.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_418.wav|106|A, The media has been great.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_208.wav|97|Would he be able to live with that?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_162.wav|6|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_010.wav|107|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_073.wav|34|I mean they have just been a disaster.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_238.wav|81|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_040.wav|91|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_190.wav|52|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_208.wav|45|It's a big deal for me.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_302.wav|54|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_389.wav|52|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_405.wav|75|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_109.wav|95|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_173.wav|68|We are all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_164.wav|95|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_045.wav|54|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_421.wav|48|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_267.wav|30|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_098.wav|36|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_210.wav|44|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_185.wav|34|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_240.wav|23|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_067.wav|83|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_063.wav|96|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_016.wav|17|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_191.wav|78|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_345.wav|44|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_287.wav|7|We accept the new rules.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_320.wav|18|That was a fairy tale.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_260.wav|39|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_310.wav|83|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_171.wav|44|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_238.wav|46|That is the key message.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_170.wav|7|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_327.wav|10|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_181.wav|91|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_257.wav|18|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_098.wav|100|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_382.wav|8|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_021.wav|67|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_352.wav|9|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_319.wav|102|I tend not to look back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_055.wav|1|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_060.wav|3|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_326.wav|24|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_372.wav|63|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_148.wav|59|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_052.wav|1|He has one son and one daughter.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_380.wav|69|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_396.wav|13|I'd rather have been playing.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_276.wav|37|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_005.wav|28|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_117.wav|46|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_369.wav|95|Last weekend he was awful.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_181.wav|99|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_191.wav|29|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_231.wav|92|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_074.wav|89|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_136.wav|83|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_246.wav|98|It's time to say enough is enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_112.wav|73|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_082.wav|22|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_318.wav|19|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_129.wav|96|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_147.wav|93|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_377.wav|77|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_156.wav|58|I am still very much a director.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_231.wav|30|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_198.wav|23|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_086.wav|76|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_358.wav|34|This is a United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_061.wav|9|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_104.wav|86|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_210.wav|18|Find them somebody they deserve.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_259.wav|14|You can never tell with the manager.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_117.wav|44|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_140.wav|71|"The boy is no longer with us."
DUMMY2/p302/p302_223.wav|30|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_364.wav|39|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_370.wav|28|I'm desperate to play in this match.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_294.wav|69|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_408.wav|10|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_178.wav|62|It was very, very dejected.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_043.wav|68|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_088.wav|75|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_219.wav|49|She was a delightful person.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_094.wav|37|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_398.wav|17|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_286.wav|21|The answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_135.wav|88|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_296.wav|68|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_022.wav|15|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_330.wav|97|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_297.wav|16|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_089.wav|94|You will be.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_153.wav|89|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_267.wav|28|It should not lose out in any way.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_018.wav|8|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_199.wav|46|It's not right of Labour.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_201.wav|67|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_292.wav|4|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_356.wav|101|I said he was set to retire.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_125.wav|34|I have been to see him.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_461.wav|95|She has reached the top of her profession.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_362.wav|22|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_348.wav|54|I am astonished by this decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_299.wav|93|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_091.wav|71|"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_357.wav|66|This is normal for him now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_107.wav|52|They are a different team at home.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_111.wav|56|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_271.wav|89|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_007.wav|61|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_084.wav|13|He had a really frustrating time last year.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_200.wav|20|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_009.wav|1|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_001.wav|72|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_195.wav|16|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_404.wav|25|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_306.wav|67|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_285.wav|29|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_056.wav|102|It comes on like a tidal wave.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_049.wav|66|Today is not about contracts.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_153.wav|83|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_354.wav|4|So it goes on.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_054.wav|12|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_136.wav|79|I've never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_065.wav|57|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_310.wav|27|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_241.wav|47|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_015.wav|84|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_097.wav|92|The mood was euphoric.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_304.wav|100|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_334.wav|97|We are not doing the Today programme.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_180.wav|97|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_266.wav|21|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_162.wav|82|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_209.wav|12|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_317.wav|60|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_173.wav|40|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_418.wav|85|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_371.wav|89|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_470.wav|48|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_125.wav|58|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_157.wav|42|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_252.wav|17|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_079.wav|52|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_191.wav|25|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_096.wav|32|In the end we made too many errors.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_248.wav|92|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_129.wav|74|It is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_168.wav|15|People also have trouble with the currency.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_170.wav|92|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_245.wav|100|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_249.wav|53|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_238.wav|21|Our positions remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_307.wav|43|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_248.wav|27|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_424.wav|14|Surrey police said no body had been found.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_370.wav|18|But there are signs of a revival.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_064.wav|45|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_149.wav|34|I said, What does this mean?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_260.wav|19|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_375.wav|76|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_272.wav|5|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_341.wav|54|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_197.wav|45|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_327.wav|56|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_242.wav|26|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_323.wav|106|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_138.wav|33|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_319.wav|2|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_296.wav|33|Were they under-age?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_230.wav|57|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_260.wav|94|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_301.wav|46|I will carry on.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_047.wav|34|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_374.wav|47|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_104.wav|28|We've all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_188.wav|104|This is simply unjust.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_451.wav|7|I never found my rhythm.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_101.wav|45|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_185.wav|65|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_304.wav|37|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_191.wav|86|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_360.wav|107|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_342.wav|50|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_304.wav|68|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_068.wav|91|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_400.wav|94|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_105.wav|28|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_119.wav|77|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_452.wav|32|But we have built a platform for next season.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_008.wav|44|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_177.wav|46|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_208.wav|24|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_264.wav|79|There is no other offer on the table.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_093.wav|84|He is in the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_177.wav|38|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_319.wav|34|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_152.wav|13|This is the root of their problems.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_386.wav|62|I've no passion for any country.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_335.wav|83|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_092.wav|55|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_063.wav|94|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_151.wav|38|It is extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_322.wav|1|We are all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_446.wav|89|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_203.wav|20|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_239.wav|70|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_265.wav|22|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_254.wav|56|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_096.wav|83|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_276.wav|9|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_406.wav|39|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_097.wav|36|We must stop it with the golf ball.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_183.wav|92|The deadline is real and absolute.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_074.wav|20|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_034.wav|103|We don't know the scale of need.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_233.wav|12|He will become the sovereign.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_283.wav|31|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_136.wav|29|This is a limited market.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_162.wav|28|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_245.wav|0|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_342.wav|95|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_223.wav|71|"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_332.wav|41|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_171.wav|90|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_050.wav|87|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_077.wav|5|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_060.wav|33|They have been very lucky with the ice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_395.wav|64|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_169.wav|19|But what are the songs about?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_220.wav|3|This conference was never confirmed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_072.wav|11|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_191.wav|43|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_339.wav|104|What's it for?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_074.wav|44|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_043.wav|67|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_168.wav|91|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_370.wav|32|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_249.wav|45|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_096.wav|105|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p231/p231_155.wav|50|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_450.wav|36|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_192.wav|51|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_147.wav|13|IT takes the biscuit.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_048.wav|75|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_448.wav|50|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_117.wav|98|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_179.wav|3|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_031.wav|38|It was no surprise.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_399.wav|36|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_223.wav|54|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_247.wav|23|She is fulfilled by it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_416.wav|64|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_086.wav|39|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_076.wav|51|I have got a knife.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_014.wav|93|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_264.wav|95|She claimed the day was for young people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_299.wav|19|The incident is being taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_204.wav|87|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_356.wav|69|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_054.wav|51|That, though, is the measure of the man.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_121.wav|30|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_398.wav|98|He put a lot of effort into it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_220.wav|19|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_005.wav|3|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_003.wav|90|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_077.wav|76|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_283.wav|61|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_004.wav|1|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_212.wav|53|It is going to change the world.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_197.wav|36|That would be my view.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_063.wav|9|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_311.wav|13|We've seen that time and time again.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_148.wav|22|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_330.wav|53|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_052.wav|84|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_281.wav|52|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_333.wav|77|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_003.wav|91|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_350.wav|76|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_385.wav|35|If you can get it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_121.wav|87|Or so the story goes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_179.wav|105|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_264.wav|64|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_206.wav|86|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_388.wav|25|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_169.wav|18|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_177.wav|18|It is simple, but profound.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_086.wav|21|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_133.wav|85|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_009.wav|3|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_298.wav|39|Its body language is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_345.wav|37|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_026.wav|11|This isn't some form of commission.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_299.wav|2|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_105.wav|6|The play was to go straight ahead.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_253.wav|82|THE waiting game continues.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_256.wav|54|But there was a shift.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_234.wav|9|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_275.wav|69|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_287.wav|43|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_395.wav|53|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_158.wav|16|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_152.wav|81|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_044.wav|104|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_251.wav|103|That is my role.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_254.wav|61|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_180.wav|26|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_329.wav|81|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_211.wav|90|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_345.wav|66|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_101.wav|80|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_149.wav|99|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_344.wav|97|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_324.wav|26|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_277.wav|2|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_400.wav|49|The conclusion is enthralling.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_081.wav|96|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_052.wav|69|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_327.wav|68|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_361.wav|24|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_014.wav|24|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_326.wav|44|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_341.wav|47|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_311.wav|30|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_368.wav|11|It is a matter for Westminster.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_053.wav|17|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_148.wav|68|All kinds of things occur.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_384.wav|79|We want this place to work.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_437.wav|36|It was support as it should be.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_112.wav|79|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_313.wav|74|You have to feel for the guy.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_262.wav|43|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_158.wav|77|This much I can tell you.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_135.wav|60|I am ready for that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_074.wav|65|I think with my experience I can help the team.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_227.wav|88|This is very good news.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_251.wav|32|Does that put pressure on us ?)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_377.wav|4|I had a wonderful time working with him.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_325.wav|99|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_261.wav|45|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_131.wav|13|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_400.wav|98|I am not that sadistic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_050.wav|63|We are a new department.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_058.wav|42|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_223.wav|53|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_119.wav|38|We tend to come good at the end.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_128.wav|25|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_051.wav|62|I was in the zone in the morning.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_015.wav|50|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_076.wav|35|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_229.wav|57|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_114.wav|98|We are getting there.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_387.wav|75|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_452.wav|8|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_126.wav|76|What's the point?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_354.wav|43|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_044.wav|63|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_252.wav|38|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_040.wav|84|We are the party of the future.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_099.wav|63|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_404.wav|51|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_344.wav|34|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_436.wav|106|They make the right decisions.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_294.wav|82|But they miss the whole point.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_233.wav|86|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_204.wav|48|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_216.wav|36|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_010.wav|57|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_095.wav|42|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_023.wav|62|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_189.wav|63|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_015.wav|98|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_366.wav|65|Five local people were injured.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_386.wav|100|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_306.wav|98|This is a very special moment for me.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_226.wav|53|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_257.wav|15|That is the key.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_199.wav|99|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_381.wav|79|They will give it a couple of years.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_372.wav|18|Just get on with it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_344.wav|19|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_116.wav|60|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_150.wav|52|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_291.wav|20|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p361/p361_056.wav|79|That is the way it is.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_173.wav|7|We have a budget in March.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_367.wav|10|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_147.wav|15|I don't think we deserved to lose.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_173.wav|94|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_007.wav|105|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_269.wav|22|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_401.wav|104|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_352.wav|47|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_274.wav|74|The second half was a different affair.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_229.wav|34|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_024.wav|48|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_469.wav|32|He will not be involved in school discipline.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_097.wav|28|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_394.wav|0|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_345.wav|85|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_347.wav|51|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_355.wav|56|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_294.wav|8|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_238.wav|93|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p261/p261_007.wav|100|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_182.wav|107|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_074.wav|56|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_186.wav|15|Film music was never the same again.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_187.wav|73|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_056.wav|20|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_383.wav|65|This is too much like Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_257.wav|97|Health care workers and labourers followed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_146.wav|78|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_082.wav|41|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_230.wav|65|Many changes are positive changes.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_295.wav|10|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_274.wav|106|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_323.wav|19|As if they ever stopped.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_093.wav|63|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_331.wav|84|Who will do it ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_150.wav|37|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_114.wav|7|The whole thing is the music.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_016.wav|74|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_010.wav|39|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_402.wav|46|It was not a foul.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_149.wav|15|We couldn't believe it at first.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_352.wav|52|Sales will begin by the end of October.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_176.wav|60|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_180.wav|4|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_090.wav|35|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_005.wav|1|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_380.wav|102|They did not threaten anyone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_346.wav|35|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_192.wav|22|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_051.wav|15|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_207.wav|16|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_153.wav|60|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_330.wav|3|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_210.wav|7|was everything done to save people ?)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_340.wav|44|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_274.wav|65|The third has yet to be named.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_310.wav|73|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_315.wav|86|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_337.wav|52|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_323.wav|87|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_304.wav|98|They are not always the same person.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_435.wav|106|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_392.wav|15|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_370.wav|42|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_118.wav|36|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_229.wav|54|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_368.wav|37|We can have no complaints.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_188.wav|84|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_037.wav|13|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_375.wav|17|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_338.wav|9|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_297.wav|84|Who can predict ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_309.wav|14|The rescue package is public money.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_165.wav|37|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_379.wav|25|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_260.wav|25|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_251.wav|11|It was not pretty.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_265.wav|65|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_195.wav|69|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_372.wav|28|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_159.wav|95|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_285.wav|76|I would never even consider it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_142.wav|35|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_139.wav|27|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_311.wav|12|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_237.wav|33|That is important for the club.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_318.wav|50|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_305.wav|24|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_322.wav|77|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_071.wav|41|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_035.wav|78|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_401.wav|66|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_421.wav|32|I was pleased with my own game.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_361.wav|94|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_024.wav|84|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_123.wav|95|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_254.wav|31|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_352.wav|48|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_099.wav|52|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_033.wav|77|I thought it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_053.wav|70|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_059.wav|86|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_065.wav|18|It has affected it, obviously.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_122.wav|48|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_380.wav|1|Debate is not just talk.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_161.wav|74|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_335.wav|85|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_254.wav|55|We were leading by two goals.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_095.wav|16|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_143.wav|30|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_037.wav|52|That was not perfect golf by any means.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_146.wav|104|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_275.wav|78|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_106.wav|50|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_451.wav|32|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_242.wav|84|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_242.wav|107|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_358.wav|66|Nothing was going to go right.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_112.wav|57|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_199.wav|40|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_385.wav|15|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_324.wav|102|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_074.wav|19|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_157.wav|41|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_238.wav|75|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_226.wav|98|The biggest resource is our staff.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_330.wav|95|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_111.wav|78|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_191.wav|79|Anything less will not do.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_365.wav|4|It's unusual to say the least.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_005.wav|101|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_300.wav|70|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_197.wav|29|The force is with them.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_225.wav|107|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_304.wav|102|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_343.wav|80|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_226.wav|84|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_209.wav|3|I will be in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_291.wav|10|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_324.wav|38|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_173.wav|38|But the Premiership is everything to us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_240.wav|37|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_062.wav|58|It was created by genocide.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_044.wav|1|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_040.wav|104|My view has now changed completely.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_073.wav|73|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_022.wav|73|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_265.wav|21|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_368.wav|83|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_102.wav|35|This was a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_358.wav|1|The goal will stay with me forever.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_165.wav|87|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_202.wav|39|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_137.wav|91|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_257.wav|66|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_234.wav|85|She said he did not look too happy.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_312.wav|14|I was there five months ago.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_306.wav|55|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_332.wav|2|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_405.wav|18|We await a decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_344.wav|7|Sunday's game was not a trial.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_131.wav|44|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_436.wav|8|I didn't get to keep it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_027.wav|3|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_221.wav|15|And, within itself, it is visionary.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_163.wav|0|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_275.wav|19|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_336.wav|62|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_015.wav|58|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_307.wav|44|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_250.wav|35|We have to compete at our own level.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_256.wav|77|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_102.wav|15|This Government is cutting taxes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_234.wav|18|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_009.wav|30|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_282.wav|78|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_395.wav|95|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_326.wav|55|Other teams moved up too.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_060.wav|1|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_252.wav|65|The pension levels will remain the same.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_254.wav|101|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_317.wav|2|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_061.wav|78|That was the difference today.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_169.wav|61|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_340.wav|5|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_107.wav|38|I didn't make those adjustments.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_327.wav|14|Job losses were also announced.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_308.wav|34|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_362.wav|48|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_216.wav|31|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_283.wav|49|I think it will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_369.wav|38|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_282.wav|50|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_009.wav|81|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_009.wav|104|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_098.wav|66|It is a great honour and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_154.wav|73|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_410.wav|26|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_216.wav|8|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_297.wav|82|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_403.wav|6|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_375.wav|32|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_273.wav|86|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_189.wav|7|Our destiny is in our own hands.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_161.wav|9|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_316.wav|40|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_234.wav|63|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_139.wav|84|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_364.wav|99|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_275.wav|13|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_419.wav|38|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_063.wav|89|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_302.wav|59|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_291.wav|12|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_069.wav|22|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_057.wav|84|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_192.wav|89|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_046.wav|102|We will continue to operate within the sport.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_197.wav|84|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_416.wav|65|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_131.wav|1|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_018.wav|26|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_110.wav|68|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_123.wav|58|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_160.wav|56|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_052.wav|9|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_292.wav|82|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_081.wav|7|Potions said he would drive.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_227.wav|52|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_242.wav|37|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_234.wav|97|That's the whole idea.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_300.wav|85|Everyone agrees with that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_177.wav|91|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_008.wav|48|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_136.wav|32|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_090.wav|40|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_357.wav|11|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_013.wav|72|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_089.wav|12|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_174.wav|34|Michael is putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_327.wav|97|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_130.wav|106|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_141.wav|75|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_139.wav|21|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_287.wav|52|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_391.wav|8|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_143.wav|2|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_219.wav|7|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_019.wav|21|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_327.wav|52|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_126.wav|30|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_016.wav|30|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_238.wav|16|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_180.wav|54|So he is open to ideas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_327.wav|48|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_272.wav|68|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_338.wav|0|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_298.wav|37|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_021.wav|74|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_156.wav|90|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_043.wav|10|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_302.wav|92|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_252.wav|90|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_384.wav|89|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_359.wav|98|I'd like to run.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_217.wav|60|We had to work hard for it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_184.wav|50|So many people will be affected by this.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_174.wav|5|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_344.wav|70|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_361.wav|48|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_101.wav|63|It really was an unusual award.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_040.wav|33|We are getting people into work.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_181.wav|80|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_417.wav|48|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_106.wav|80|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_152.wav|35|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_336.wav|66|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_025.wav|103|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_468.wav|100|No options are excluded at all.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_081.wav|55|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_160.wav|24|He was pleased with his display.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_200.wav|103|But these were the nights.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_178.wav|98|The bombing has had a huge influence.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_153.wav|35|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_139.wav|51|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_016.wav|60|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_396.wav|39|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_228.wav|98|How will we get there?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_277.wav|14|He is quite well organised.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_140.wav|84|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_101.wav|81|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_176.wav|14|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_403.wav|0|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_050.wav|9|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_269.wav|11|We don't need to change the law.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_357.wav|86|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_279.wav|105|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_235.wav|24|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_330.wav|48|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_151.wav|62|I fell into it by accident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_300.wav|64|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_259.wav|34|He said to me, Which one, son?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_335.wav|89|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_082.wav|67|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_388.wav|40|I'm glad I came.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_256.wav|15|This will have no effect on the championship.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_379.wav|49|There's no support for it at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_192.wav|48|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_194.wav|76|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_193.wav|18|That was very important.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_045.wav|19|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_188.wav|57|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_410.wav|19|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_245.wav|17|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_308.wav|25|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_388.wav|36|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_363.wav|29|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_086.wav|87|He's not getting into any games.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_006.wav|67|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_207.wav|55|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_241.wav|39|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_157.wav|52|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_010.wav|41|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_026.wav|37|The first appeared to be successful.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_365.wav|89|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_233.wav|63|These things have not happened by accident.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_111.wav|14|Our house was very small.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_008.wav|105|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_343.wav|100|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_259.wav|89|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_391.wav|23|I do not believe they are.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_353.wav|59|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_221.wav|41|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_413.wav|42|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_217.wav|99|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_037.wav|45|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_396.wav|69|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_401.wav|56|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_126.wav|80|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_103.wav|41|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_275.wav|95|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_207.wav|31|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_142.wav|61|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_217.wav|33|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_286.wav|66|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_221.wav|43|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_199.wav|95|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_331.wav|55|Our relationship has been very good.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_074.wav|107|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_233.wav|3|But it may not be all bad news.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_074.wav|83|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_204.wav|63|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_137.wav|77|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_423.wav|34|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_418.wav|19|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_016.wav|72|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_146.wav|27|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_149.wav|95|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_212.wav|52|It is going to change the world.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_387.wav|39|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_409.wav|105|It goes with the job.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_019.wav|26|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_296.wav|82|I said, What was that about?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_186.wav|38|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_070.wav|62|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_336.wav|70|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_336.wav|24|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_197.wav|104|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_160.wav|62|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_130.wav|89|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_068.wav|35|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_068.wav|105|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_269.wav|91|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_347.wav|62|Saddam is not threatening this country.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_014.wav|3|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_432.wav|36|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_362.wav|86|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_329.wav|29|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_258.wav|23|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_227.wav|12|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_333.wav|69|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_255.wav|12|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_130.wav|77|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_359.wav|65|It had been introduced over six years.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_495.wav|24|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_011.wav|41|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_092.wav|107|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_138.wav|0|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_318.wav|22|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_062.wav|33|My players are special.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_148.wav|61|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_455.wav|100|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_377.wav|103|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_386.wav|89|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_339.wav|75|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_381.wav|11|He was taken ill in his office.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_303.wav|68|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_041.wav|65|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_126.wav|48|Their season has been consigned to history.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_221.wav|81|But she was.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_151.wav|12|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_193.wav|5|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_189.wav|92|That's how he did the damage.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_183.wav|37|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_231.wav|37|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_092.wav|37|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_169.wav|106|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_204.wav|28|Was this a new event?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_142.wav|101|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_073.wav|79|It is on the news.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_008.wav|33|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_355.wav|66|I have not been so angry for years.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_092.wav|34|Will they fall out?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_176.wav|17|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_395.wav|38|His condition was stable last night.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_240.wav|36|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_260.wav|103|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_300.wav|15|How can they get one?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_180.wav|50|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_086.wav|67|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_325.wav|16|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_181.wav|40|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_120.wav|87|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_072.wav|56|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_086.wav|62|Action must be taken urgently.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_397.wav|22|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_035.wav|40|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_384.wav|58|There is a lot of anger.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_166.wav|74|It was very exciting.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_284.wav|48|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_032.wav|75|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_229.wav|78|It still has an effect.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_283.wav|7|I should think so, too.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_246.wav|21|He died later in hospital.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_033.wav|66|Everything was up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_371.wav|40|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_076.wav|102|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_077.wav|17|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_249.wav|75|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_375.wav|69|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_341.wav|83|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_118.wav|83|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_003.wav|64|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_140.wav|19|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_134.wav|40|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_039.wav|81|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_316.wav|92|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_415.wav|97|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_288.wav|36|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_092.wav|63|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_434.wav|37|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_359.wav|63|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_081.wav|65|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_332.wav|12|He made no big mistakes.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_114.wav|25|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_280.wav|19|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_439.wav|8|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_027.wav|95|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_274.wav|78|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_379.wav|2|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_403.wav|36|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_177.wav|56|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_377.wav|66|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_155.wav|60|First meeting was next week.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_059.wav|4|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_056.wav|7|They had been in Scotland on exercise.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_336.wav|68|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_152.wav|47|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_111.wav|48|Instead, another depression came in.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_235.wav|54|I think we have a very strong case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_129.wav|26|The move has provoked a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_125.wav|40|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_216.wav|10|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_153.wav|48|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_145.wav|33|It's just a fact.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_164.wav|42|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_191.wav|73|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_287.wav|73|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_029.wav|100|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_216.wav|60|But sometimes it was even worse.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_073.wav|17|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_094.wav|5|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_300.wav|102|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_091.wav|48|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_073.wav|6|It was just an accident.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_003.wav|65|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p232/p232_140.wav|96|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_295.wav|53|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_196.wav|25|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_214.wav|10|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p227/p227_035.wav|29|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_350.wav|49|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_302.wav|41|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_261.wav|66|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_400.wav|100|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_063.wav|49|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_148.wav|90|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_285.wav|42|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_138.wav|63|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_272.wav|61|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_242.wav|57|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_240.wav|77|He would not impose a fine.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_449.wav|8|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_173.wav|9|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_200.wav|81|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_164.wav|60|It is a new company for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_278.wav|61|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_082.wav|48|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_210.wav|102|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_397.wav|97|What's the theme?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_288.wav|23|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_099.wav|91|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_358.wav|3|Something is going to have to give.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_258.wav|83|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_029.wav|31|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_221.wav|65|Britain will be little affected.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_248.wav|78|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_258.wav|100|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_328.wav|94|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_248.wav|36|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_039.wav|50|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_192.wav|39|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_006.wav|28|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_189.wav|52|The story was not made public by this club.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_031.wav|62|This is excellent news for the workforce.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_130.wav|65|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_225.wav|18|We are looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_101.wav|5|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_149.wav|96|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_272.wav|74|That was our mission.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_261.wav|83|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_057.wav|11|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_149.wav|68|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_212.wav|42|THE atmosphere was electric.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_160.wav|71|"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_265.wav|29|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_108.wav|59|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_373.wav|13|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_307.wav|1|The festival idea has been a great success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_064.wav|26|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_246.wav|69|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_322.wav|3|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_088.wav|83|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_186.wav|80|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_326.wav|76|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_256.wav|107|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_017.wav|56|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_024.wav|66|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_462.wav|95|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_133.wav|39|They have to come clean.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_273.wav|92|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_069.wav|64|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_344.wav|46|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_195.wav|41|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_087.wav|36|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_263.wav|54|We can only go up.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_433.wav|48|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_176.wav|13|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_250.wav|46|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_418.wav|32|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_189.wav|8|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_099.wav|83|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_168.wav|63|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_243.wav|44|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_244.wav|20|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_110.wav|36|That is the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_223.wav|89|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_145.wav|45|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_074.wav|5|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_189.wav|105|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_361.wav|10|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_391.wav|70|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_185.wav|2|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_069.wav|48|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_346.wav|103|Later they changed their minds.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_219.wav|67|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_325.wav|48|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_187.wav|92|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_272.wav|87|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_237.wav|106|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_319.wav|90|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_325.wav|2|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_059.wav|5|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_366.wav|54|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_311.wav|74|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_302.wav|50|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_331.wav|77|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_329.wav|98|We'll see what happens.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_076.wav|95|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_253.wav|38|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_284.wav|9|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_257.wav|8|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_338.wav|97|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_345.wav|83|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_445.wav|63|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_341.wav|77|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_068.wav|89|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_409.wav|63|They were a lovely family.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_385.wav|92|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_249.wav|31|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_291.wav|4|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_392.wav|24|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_346.wav|91|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_255.wav|88|This is as bad as it gets.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_067.wav|54|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_090.wav|102|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_351.wav|44|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_037.wav|26|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_040.wav|10|This will get their attention.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_114.wav|77|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_153.wav|28|It will benefit a lot of people.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_124.wav|48|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_078.wav|18|Maybe he will act again.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_146.wav|98|He was always nice to me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_026.wav|107|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_166.wav|95|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_096.wav|73|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_038.wav|97|We see little sign of improvement.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_343.wav|53|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_361.wav|103|There was support from across the board.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_145.wav|98|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_274.wav|40|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_314.wav|24|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_038.wav|94|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_379.wav|33|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_229.wav|48|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_043.wav|93|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_336.wav|21|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_434.wav|32|This is a limited market.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_139.wav|73|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_294.wav|44|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_088.wav|48|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_039.wav|92|I think he was nervous to begin with.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_309.wav|97|No other country has ever won this tournament.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_177.wav|97|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_107.wav|10|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_103.wav|26|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_285.wav|92|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_228.wav|88|Is it a warning to parents?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_011.wav|18|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_100.wav|81|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_216.wav|46|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_329.wav|100|The City welcomed the numbers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_256.wav|69|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_401.wav|2|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_018.wav|106|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_396.wav|29|It is a terrible equation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_161.wav|92|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_327.wav|66|It was chaotic and frightening.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_255.wav|89|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_283.wav|36|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_364.wav|34|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_192.wav|77|I can't play the game for them.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_241.wav|33|They want to play in the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_128.wav|17|They don't have to, but they normally do.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_112.wav|56|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_038.wav|15|Was this a new event?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_187.wav|8|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_216.wav|23|A web site's planned for November.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_199.wav|3|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_234.wav|51|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_353.wav|9|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_002.wav|20|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_023.wav|22|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_274.wav|18|However, it is going to happen.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_222.wav|13|It's up to the defence team.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_046.wav|0|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_354.wav|63|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_405.wav|51|You name it, they have it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_236.wav|84|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_282.wav|104|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_250.wav|48|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_158.wav|29|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_410.wav|103|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_103.wav|89|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_301.wav|34|However, many questions remained unanswered.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_113.wav|96|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_033.wav|65|It felt right for me.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_054.wav|89|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_239.wav|44|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_147.wav|62|I've never regretted coming here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_061.wav|66|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_238.wav|104|They will do nothing for the local people.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_302.wav|23|It will vote with the US.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_280.wav|13|That never happens in real life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_255.wav|15|We are in a very strong position.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_041.wav|86|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_253.wav|93|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_249.wav|9|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_132.wav|14|Which can happen any time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_138.wav|56|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_175.wav|103|It is highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_197.wav|16|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_105.wav|2|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_050.wav|18|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_303.wav|55|Tomorrow will be my last.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_203.wav|30|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_066.wav|82|That is part of athletics.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_165.wav|20|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_219.wav|78|THE force is with them.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_250.wav|15|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_389.wav|32|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_163.wav|87|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_123.wav|50|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_332.wav|40|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_240.wav|25|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_159.wav|80|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_261.wav|91|We're not travel agents.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_282.wav|84|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_337.wav|6|I just had to go for it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_359.wav|38|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_147.wav|19|We haven't found out anything different.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_246.wav|44|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_303.wav|81|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_074.wav|17|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_160.wav|46|We have not had a formal request.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_027.wav|19|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_107.wav|84|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_019.wav|59|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_406.wav|40|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_076.wav|14|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_204.wav|46|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_264.wav|27|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_297.wav|69|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_162.wav|76|The General Election is all to play for.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_216.wav|103|We are opening an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_245.wav|38|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_082.wav|60|We never publicise it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_308.wav|100|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_319.wav|41|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_146.wav|39|Any success would have been an improvement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_110.wav|1|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_358.wav|41|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_198.wav|96|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_311.wav|15|This is the only problem with the story.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_375.wav|37|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_302.wav|58|They were the better side on the day.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_133.wav|95|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_260.wav|55|My goals have never changed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_189.wav|0|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_065.wav|68|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_407.wav|50|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_143.wav|3|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_178.wav|60|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_307.wav|87|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_397.wav|54|She had every right to read the warrant.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_237.wav|0|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_286.wav|28|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_068.wav|67|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_111.wav|38|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_246.wav|34|It appears to have been closed down.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_061.wav|4|I don't have a problem with getting older.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_107.wav|70|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_102.wav|39|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_422.wav|22|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_475.wav|14|The chief constable has retired.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_235.wav|68|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_055.wav|52|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_309.wav|28|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_051.wav|31|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_465.wav|32|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_393.wav|91|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_101.wav|13|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_249.wav|37|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_457.wav|89|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_026.wav|10|These decisions are not simple.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_116.wav|46|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_265.wav|88|Israeli forces denied the claim.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_359.wav|106|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_291.wav|25|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_405.wav|39|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_321.wav|15|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_301.wav|99|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_356.wav|41|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_184.wav|38|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_459.wav|37|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_341.wav|0|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_471.wav|7|Let that be their memorial.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_249.wav|57|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_353.wav|86|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_141.wav|47|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_279.wav|95|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_329.wav|33|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_341.wav|64|Cinema is a communal experience.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_076.wav|7|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_057.wav|97|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_149.wav|17|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_212.wav|55|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_206.wav|94|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_281.wav|90|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_298.wav|91|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_224.wav|28|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_357.wav|29|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_017.wav|70|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_037.wav|14|The ambition this year is to improve on last.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_003.wav|36|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_241.wav|107|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_205.wav|61|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_109.wav|50|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_341.wav|1|One person was believed to have been hit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_327.wav|34|It's such a shock.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_018.wav|29|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_305.wav|33|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_383.wav|69|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_464.wav|65|Scotland needs this award.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_009.wav|93|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_161.wav|15|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_331.wav|59|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_299.wav|74|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_266.wav|37|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_255.wav|9|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_026.wav|93|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_331.wav|92|I certainly think it should be there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_326.wav|17|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_042.wav|39|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_111.wav|5|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_219.wav|56|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_370.wav|75|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_391.wav|64|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_225.wav|37|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_182.wav|30|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_156.wav|66|It was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_076.wav|16|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_196.wav|15|That's how it works.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_211.wav|88|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_142.wav|37|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_071.wav|7|Today it was really enjoyable.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_005.wav|97|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_284.wav|3|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_166.wav|50|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_146.wav|105|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_032.wav|42|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_240.wav|79|Four of the victims were women.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_024.wav|17|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_261.wav|79|What can you do?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_124.wav|79|I didn't think about it again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_010.wav|72|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_243.wav|71|"I can't get a job."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_372.wav|39|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_437.wav|50|The growth potential is enormous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_190.wav|29|This is the time to use it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_340.wav|67|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_142.wav|94|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_346.wav|7|McNaughton was not so sure.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_388.wav|1|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_288.wav|92|WE live in a world of large numbers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_101.wav|79|He knows he is good.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_317.wav|18|Yet there is hope.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_033.wav|46|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_278.wav|23|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_413.wav|103|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_288.wav|94|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_069.wav|29|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_269.wav|37|It was a bit of a tightrope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_185.wav|91|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_344.wav|102|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_110.wav|44|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_274.wav|62|It was a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_338.wav|66|It broke up my marriage.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_412.wav|106|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_318.wav|89|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_371.wav|107|We have fun in our lives.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_382.wav|29|This will impact on us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_234.wav|71|"We have a free vote on these things in our party."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_052.wav|82|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_126.wav|33|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_268.wav|17|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_040.wav|97|The gaffer was great.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_332.wav|98|There is a problem.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_070.wav|61|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_202.wav|22|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_145.wav|35|She has gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_077.wav|41|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_036.wav|103|We had a huge response to that campaign.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_102.wav|33|That is not true.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_010.wav|38|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_023.wav|47|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_340.wav|62|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_128.wav|19|What has changed since then?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_082.wav|89|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_131.wav|84|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_305.wav|102|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_354.wav|10|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_295.wav|97|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_095.wav|76|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_039.wav|43|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_112.wav|69|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_295.wav|20|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_316.wav|27|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_371.wav|1|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_144.wav|6|How does it all work?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_232.wav|54|There will not be any charges.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_344.wav|35|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_259.wav|81|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_024.wav|99|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_020.wav|100|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_291.wav|45|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_470.wav|39|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_368.wav|53|It was a goal which came from nothing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_410.wav|40|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_371.wav|29|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_211.wav|77|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_112.wav|27|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_110.wav|29|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_319.wav|76|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_231.wav|94|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_351.wav|16|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_199.wav|96|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_441.wav|37|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_336.wav|57|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_424.wav|72|Public safety is paramount.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_371.wav|13|It's their duty to protect them.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_227.wav|92|We don't have any senior players.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_101.wav|53|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_238.wav|47|He's got to go.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_193.wav|84|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_170.wav|83|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_344.wav|17|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_021.wav|81|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_342.wav|41|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_361.wav|56|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_153.wav|92|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_417.wav|15|I had no idea.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_007.wav|78|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_278.wav|106|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_144.wav|8|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_082.wav|91|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_197.wav|98|Inspections are not the problem.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_349.wav|34|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_246.wav|8|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_387.wav|42|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_057.wav|12|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_218.wav|37|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_011.wav|49|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_268.wav|90|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_192.wav|0|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_276.wav|103|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_009.wav|85|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_094.wav|55|The car driver died.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_004.wav|56|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_128.wav|58|I was pleased with my own game.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_112.wav|92|It is reform in return for resources.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_237.wav|66|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_315.wav|12|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_351.wav|50|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_325.wav|49|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_405.wav|72|He said it was his greatest work.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_312.wav|42|Our number one goal is prevention.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_074.wav|14|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_068.wav|6|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_321.wav|78|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_173.wav|50|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_302.wav|42|I want my audience to be challenged.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_152.wav|1|O, Is there a lot of blood?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_232.wav|56|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_153.wav|68|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_318.wav|58|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_167.wav|28|About the bad things that happened to me.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_115.wav|51|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_071.wav|50|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_241.wav|23|So what's wrong with Scotland?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_362.wav|27|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_338.wav|107|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_046.wav|37|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_186.wav|6|He had an apartment ready.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_112.wav|43|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_448.wav|36|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_149.wav|8|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_352.wav|82|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_056.wav|12|It comes on like a tidal wave.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_297.wav|91|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_413.wav|60|This is not the end.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_011.wav|62|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_059.wav|105|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_361.wav|84|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_292.wav|26|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_318.wav|41|He was not a big name.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_192.wav|61|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_101.wav|73|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_146.wav|8|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_029.wav|93|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_383.wav|54|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_019.wav|105|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_058.wav|56|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_411.wav|37|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_016.wav|50|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_010.wav|12|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_080.wav|72|It is bad news for us and England.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_365.wav|45|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_213.wav|65|It was men against boys.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_434.wav|95|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_131.wav|57|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_215.wav|88|I believe it would have been successful.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_218.wav|19|It is not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_075.wav|57|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_038.wav|73|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_010.wav|86|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_331.wav|21|He was a one off.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_200.wav|79|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_091.wav|23|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_041.wav|62|I shouldn't have put up with it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_044.wav|26|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_228.wav|48|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_398.wav|25|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_006.wav|98|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_051.wav|32|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_175.wav|95|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_174.wav|98|The support from the general public was astounding.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_065.wav|73|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_197.wav|18|We are going to have a party.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_370.wav|55|The whole system is too complex.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_406.wav|18|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_206.wav|6|The training will take place in Downing Street.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_305.wav|2|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_311.wav|51|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_413.wav|37|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_327.wav|20|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_241.wav|6|That ignorance is crucial.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_047.wav|68|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_051.wav|30|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_292.wav|14|It was exactly four months away.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_170.wav|28|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_182.wav|54|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_091.wav|61|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_259.wav|100|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_058.wav|65|What do we do?)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_415.wav|95|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_075.wav|105|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_352.wav|10|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_355.wav|78|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_345.wav|55|He would add value.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_265.wav|83|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_394.wav|95|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_104.wav|103|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_012.wav|57|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_175.wav|24|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_276.wav|57|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_148.wav|9|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_223.wav|94|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_060.wav|20|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_273.wav|2|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_030.wav|68|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_216.wav|15|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_004.wav|17|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_327.wav|12|It may also be her last.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_231.wav|100|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_346.wav|73|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_131.wav|6|It is very simple.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_319.wav|84|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_389.wav|96|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_270.wav|87|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_005.wav|50|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_022.wav|41|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_130.wav|27|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_082.wav|56|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_004.wav|72|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_343.wav|45|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_125.wav|43|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_202.wav|23|It would also take time.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_373.wav|75|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_073.wav|22|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_348.wav|7|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_198.wav|40|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_005.wav|19|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_020.wav|63|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_041.wav|82|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_221.wav|13|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_148.wav|104|We are all very proud of her.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_052.wav|106|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_422.wav|1|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_122.wav|87|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_283.wav|89|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_242.wav|31|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_405.wav|17|And that started me thinking.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_326.wav|36|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_147.wav|27|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_390.wav|14|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_268.wav|78|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_092.wav|38|We already have them, all over Europe.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_402.wav|54|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_328.wav|35|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_147.wav|60|Our players are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_141.wav|30|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_177.wav|37|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_445.wav|14|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_172.wav|76|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_107.wav|12|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_036.wav|9|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_277.wav|41|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_382.wav|49|Writing has diminished in value.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_243.wav|7|The transaction is not feasible.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_346.wav|51|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_336.wav|35|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_286.wav|49|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_181.wav|103|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_029.wav|96|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_266.wav|106|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_375.wav|74|It has been a frustrating one.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_191.wav|103|This will be just another tax on motorists.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_417.wav|34|It's been a humbling year.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_049.wav|42|Things start to talk to each other.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_047.wav|2|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_369.wav|52|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_082.wav|61|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_194.wav|20|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_133.wav|43|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_055.wav|9|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_106.wav|87|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_054.wav|96|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_060.wav|19|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_125.wav|96|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_276.wav|87|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_078.wav|72|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_277.wav|36|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_180.wav|90|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_044.wav|58|Today is not about contracts.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_306.wav|57|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_184.wav|92|No means testing will be required.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_116.wav|80|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_205.wav|95|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_184.wav|78|It should never have happened.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_021.wav|45|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_212.wav|13|I am appalled by this news.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_208.wav|65|Her experience is certainly limited.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_171.wav|20|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_151.wav|33|He is walking free.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_377.wav|87|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_003.wav|92|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_246.wav|4|The English are coming.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_392.wav|74|I don't believe in God.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_347.wav|82|I made a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_144.wav|86|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_061.wav|71|"Four other charges were dropped."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_169.wav|2|I carried on for him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_167.wav|51|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_125.wav|57|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_299.wav|9|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_413.wav|51|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_019.wav|1|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_290.wav|6|The best team won.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_070.wav|79|We have a strong team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_410.wav|39|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_388.wav|15|The potential is always in the idea.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_101.wav|24|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_353.wav|99|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_368.wav|57|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_239.wav|74|They are now collapsing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_268.wav|93|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_177.wav|22|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_292.wav|5|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_142.wav|55|That shows the impact it had.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_119.wav|3|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_245.wav|44|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_291.wav|81|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_234.wav|54|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_004.wav|100|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_385.wav|72|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_115.wav|36|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_360.wav|92|But that is entirely a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_157.wav|98|I want my audience to be challenged.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_266.wav|54|He is a man who lives to work.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_063.wav|46|It sounded awfully like panic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_130.wav|66|I am now just a bit uneasy.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_231.wav|18|I think we can get there.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_422.wav|75|The fate of the rest is unknown.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_385.wav|94|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_094.wav|29|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_026.wav|88|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_205.wav|89|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_339.wav|105|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_126.wav|91|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_217.wav|77|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_280.wav|94|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_226.wav|67|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_218.wav|105|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_043.wav|75|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_016.wav|21|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_325.wav|47|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_284.wav|26|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_278.wav|98|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_301.wav|15|It was an insult.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_306.wav|75|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_175.wav|17|However, you have just got to adjust it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_120.wav|63|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_242.wav|99|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_104.wav|74|So what is the problem?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_308.wav|2|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_147.wav|2|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_104.wav|77|I was impressed with them.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_061.wav|49|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_358.wav|99|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_075.wav|43|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_121.wav|11|Paterson was the man.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_013.wav|83|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_228.wav|61|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_339.wav|46|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_343.wav|16|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_168.wav|22|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_372.wav|6|I think we did well.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_209.wav|28|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_026.wav|41|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_404.wav|85|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_224.wav|22|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_052.wav|39|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_068.wav|19|However, there is great potential in this right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_241.wav|75|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_170.wav|63|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_259.wav|80|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_010.wav|28|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_326.wav|8|Survival is not an option.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_399.wav|76|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_246.wav|78|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_225.wav|81|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_113.wav|79|He is a pro.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_285.wav|69|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_255.wav|72|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_369.wav|20|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_318.wav|73|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_227.wav|43|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_284.wav|64|There is something in this.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_245.wav|6|I have not had much of him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_023.wav|13|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_076.wav|92|But then they scored their fourth.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_039.wav|75|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_006.wav|55|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_077.wav|86|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_306.wav|97|I got on very well with Allan.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_203.wav|100|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_311.wav|47|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_228.wav|90|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_009.wav|2|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_415.wav|39|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_070.wav|7|Even the one she loved.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_278.wav|38|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_165.wav|84|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_022.wav|47|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_031.wav|15|They responded in the most positive way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_344.wav|92|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_172.wav|68|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_092.wav|89|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_283.wav|9|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_160.wav|57|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_099.wav|106|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_256.wav|41|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_213.wav|0|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_108.wav|15|I know he meant it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_252.wav|88|It was a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_256.wav|14|It might be sad, but it's a fact.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_091.wav|13|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_389.wav|58|Maybe, who knows?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_217.wav|80|This is a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_310.wav|107|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_256.wav|8|Labour was too busy to respond.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_009.wav|16|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_089.wav|58|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_382.wav|39|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_331.wav|69|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_149.wav|38|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_315.wav|78|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_028.wav|85|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_477.wav|24|The chief constable has retired.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_334.wav|66|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_284.wav|99|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_299.wav|102|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_149.wav|60|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_286.wav|95|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_067.wav|7|She died in hospital two hours later.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_199.wav|59|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_202.wav|34|She is not in a coma.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_143.wav|82|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_354.wav|107|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_145.wav|74|He will have to live with his words.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_243.wav|76|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_168.wav|61|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_027.wav|46|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_107.wav|92|He had a different agenda entirely.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_150.wav|53|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_120.wav|13|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_268.wav|42|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_338.wav|89|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_381.wav|87|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_286.wav|6|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_102.wav|89|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_177.wav|40|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_111.wav|0|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_296.wav|75|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_049.wav|87|The latter option was chosen.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_031.wav|46|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_269.wav|103|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_033.wav|95|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_303.wav|31|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_031.wav|81|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_167.wav|104|It had until tomorrow to comply.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_062.wav|74|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_028.wav|11|We did it in one take.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_060.wav|26|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_317.wav|98|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_204.wav|73|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_363.wav|35|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_343.wav|52|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_036.wav|1|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_103.wav|77|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_462.wav|89|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_308.wav|82|I can't say anything about any figure.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_085.wav|93|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_398.wav|72|It would have been a very explosive issue.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_259.wav|90|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_400.wav|63|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_176.wav|30|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_009.wav|17|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_063.wav|27|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_143.wav|15|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_373.wav|106|Brown has always protested his innocence.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_045.wav|69|He's just in it for himself.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_388.wav|100|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_183.wav|28|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_220.wav|44|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_044.wav|42|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_329.wav|105|We must do something.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_136.wav|22|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_077.wav|38|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_117.wav|8|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_199.wav|87|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_154.wav|15|Wrong decisions Address in full
DUMMY2/p335/p335_049.wav|49|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_163.wav|43|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_004.wav|80|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_283.wav|77|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_122.wav|84|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_335.wav|81|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_285.wav|33|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_234.wav|59|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_107.wav|69|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_361.wav|63|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_370.wav|49|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_342.wav|60|The atmosphere was excellent.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_077.wav|90|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_023.wav|80|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_142.wav|5|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_293.wav|90|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_408.wav|36|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_245.wav|42|I am sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_079.wav|79|We have never been short of volunteers.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_037.wav|59|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_229.wav|14|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_114.wav|59|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_399.wav|103|He is a joy to watch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_282.wav|64|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_209.wav|13|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_321.wav|61|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_257.wav|32|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_145.wav|79|She has never mentioned it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_089.wav|11|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_203.wav|99|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_101.wav|72|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_201.wav|54|The actors just have to say so.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_467.wav|32|The answer was up there on the stage.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_223.wav|74|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_297.wav|0|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_336.wav|64|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_063.wav|84|That could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_252.wav|81|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_078.wav|75|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_154.wav|7|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_041.wav|103|He will never walk the streets again.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_282.wav|100|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_011.wav|99|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_178.wav|41|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_127.wav|19|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_396.wav|72|I doubt it would be genuine.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_429.wav|63|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_120.wav|49|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_407.wav|10|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_161.wav|44|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_025.wav|49|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_220.wav|101|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_412.wav|4|Of course we aren't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_168.wav|14|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_129.wav|67|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_246.wav|61|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_060.wav|74|He played really, really well.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_291.wav|53|He would get into any world team.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_248.wav|44|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_244.wav|22|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_295.wav|35|It's got to come from me.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_158.wav|90|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_216.wav|57|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_347.wav|17|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_094.wav|22|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_401.wav|92|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_081.wav|34|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_229.wav|27|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_324.wav|12|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_305.wav|1|They still have the dirty work to do.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_076.wav|57|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_087.wav|41|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_188.wav|105|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_027.wav|51|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_188.wav|6|THERE's only one word for it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_068.wav|4|I was the trial judge in both.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_162.wav|48|I think the referee was good.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_089.wav|32|The processing plant was closed yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_001.wav|79|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_124.wav|64|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_477.wav|48|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_339.wav|61|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_175.wav|71|"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_390.wav|18|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_313.wav|15|Knowledge is everything at this level.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_222.wav|15|Are you up for business?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_158.wav|52|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_248.wav|91|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_147.wav|52|You should feel involved in their lives.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_443.wav|65|We would deal first with the biggest party.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_158.wav|101|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_378.wav|36|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_128.wav|4|It was a bit of a shock.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_125.wav|33|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_414.wav|105|I have so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_173.wav|19|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_130.wav|26|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_295.wav|87|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_340.wav|80|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_155.wav|48|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_275.wav|39|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_286.wav|24|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_001.wav|94|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_126.wav|44|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_148.wav|16|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_069.wav|54|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_001.wav|13|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_272.wav|46|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_110.wav|30|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_063.wav|51|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_258.wav|30|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_178.wav|63|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_153.wav|102|We need some confidence to get a win.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_095.wav|25|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_048.wav|18|We have to work together.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_300.wav|96|What has altered ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_352.wav|67|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_120.wav|48|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_222.wav|14|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_303.wav|76|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_087.wav|95|I'd like to see the business case.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_132.wav|13|What's happening to her?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_474.wav|65|I've got to win here to be happy.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_330.wav|100|You will never get a conviction.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_264.wav|13|However, by then the damage had been done.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_148.wav|51|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_281.wav|68|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_218.wav|89|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_272.wav|27|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_245.wav|60|We deserved the draw.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_377.wav|100|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_374.wav|14|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_007.wav|98|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_066.wav|6|Lovely day isn't it?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_065.wav|49|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_324.wav|87|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_194.wav|27|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_071.wav|91|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_195.wav|65|Had this been common practice?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_091.wav|86|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_096.wav|40|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_101.wav|48|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_135.wav|59|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_130.wav|57|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_331.wav|25|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_113.wav|64|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_216.wav|41|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_082.wav|79|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_121.wav|59|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_282.wav|28|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_312.wav|100|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_217.wav|38|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_392.wav|50|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_004.wav|76|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_313.wav|22|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_306.wav|72|He is married, with two children.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_313.wav|35|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_264.wav|30|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_218.wav|85|I didn't just walk in and get it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_396.wav|33|You read it right.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_051.wav|103|I didn't have a clue.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_009.wav|55|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_319.wav|60|It won't be their last.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_007.wav|106|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_347.wav|86|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_118.wav|51|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_038.wav|44|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_116.wav|2|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_117.wav|7|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_181.wav|8|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_316.wav|29|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_280.wav|47|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_451.wav|63|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_102.wav|81|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_303.wav|100|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_371.wav|102|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_170.wav|71|"The release attracted little attention."
DUMMY2/p284/p284_391.wav|16|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_114.wav|44|The cold war is over.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_423.wav|85|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_188.wav|55|London remained the favourite.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_195.wav|55|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_078.wav|21|They were at school together.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_399.wav|20|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_133.wav|47|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_091.wav|107|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_007.wav|21|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_161.wav|68|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_197.wav|43|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_396.wav|94|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_391.wav|96|You thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_408.wav|46|There is great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_113.wav|81|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_316.wav|26|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_209.wav|78|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_218.wav|3|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_244.wav|40|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_248.wav|51|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_055.wav|79|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_272.wav|67|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_366.wav|34|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_243.wav|97|It's like English in its underwear.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_113.wav|101|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_279.wav|65|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_373.wav|87|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_029.wav|69|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_307.wav|94|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_359.wav|42|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_142.wav|99|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_229.wav|43|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_127.wav|54|How do you respond to losing your child?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_122.wav|25|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_057.wav|0|That way I won't have to do anything.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_129.wav|71|"If not, a deal could take many months."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_129.wav|77|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_164.wav|25|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_315.wav|61|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_154.wav|27|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_049.wav|94|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_347.wav|106|You just have to give yourself a chance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_362.wav|41|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_088.wav|105|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_392.wav|7|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_317.wav|29|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_300.wav|100|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_251.wav|35|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_298.wav|74|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_333.wav|36|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_397.wav|74|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_175.wav|16|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_228.wav|5|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_350.wav|96|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_414.wav|32|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_373.wav|65|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_187.wav|34|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_351.wav|48|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_079.wav|50|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_444.wav|50|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_468.wav|7|She came to the Highland Show.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_317.wav|102|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_444.wav|27|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_048.wav|79|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_233.wav|83|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_210.wav|27|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_223.wav|98|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_295.wav|33|She thought she was going to die.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_306.wav|13|His descent was pathetic.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_251.wav|53|However, the figures tell a different story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_001.wav|61|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_238.wav|68|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_338.wav|85|The air campaign is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_251.wav|96|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_134.wav|0|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_233.wav|96|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_233.wav|31|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_142.wav|75|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_010.wav|2|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_343.wav|15|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_369.wav|84|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_205.wav|85|The gap is narrowing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_136.wav|40|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_156.wav|102|This is a foolish idea.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_144.wav|49|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_298.wav|79|If we don't do it, someone else will.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_131.wav|59|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_188.wav|8|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_030.wav|72|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_024.wav|104|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_401.wav|89|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_041.wav|41|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_155.wav|22|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_310.wav|36|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_291.wav|93|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_079.wav|81|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_051.wav|90|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_285.wav|13|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_228.wav|21|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_075.wav|80|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_371.wav|14|The members have voted against it.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_039.wav|76|It helped me to get noticed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_234.wav|36|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_279.wav|40|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_082.wav|98|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_245.wav|12|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_304.wav|57|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_187.wav|52|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_261.wav|72|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_364.wav|82|The Government would be ready, they said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_191.wav|67|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_124.wav|54|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_246.wav|2|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_240.wav|104|We got the guarantee.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_348.wav|33|Money is not everything in life.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_244.wav|37|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_152.wav|92|We are right at the heart of Europe.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_101.wav|43|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_241.wav|24|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_295.wav|54|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_264.wav|11|But what did it matter?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_216.wav|7|Here the picture is broadly stable.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_193.wav|50|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_052.wav|71|"They had to explain it."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_075.wav|34|That is my personal view.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_020.wav|47|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_204.wav|38|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_245.wav|2|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_093.wav|82|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_004.wav|32|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_345.wav|15|The support of Britain is assumed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_020.wav|14|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p266/p266_376.wav|20|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_307.wav|28|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_295.wav|81|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_377.wav|60|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_367.wav|18|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_276.wav|25|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_176.wav|64|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_342.wav|18|That's why he is the prime minister.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_315.wav|75|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_416.wav|18|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_005.wav|64|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_191.wav|62|He never asked me for money.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_094.wav|106|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_245.wav|35|I was just a kid.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_207.wav|59|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_333.wav|34|She was totally possessed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_076.wav|67|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_289.wav|59|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_185.wav|44|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_148.wav|60|It is deeply frustrating.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_212.wav|81|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_304.wav|6|Not all women are dismayed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_102.wav|8|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_109.wav|11|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_265.wav|16|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_071.wav|79|This is a dream come true.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_013.wav|77|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_186.wav|20|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_137.wav|80|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_391.wav|107|Would you take them?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_309.wav|18|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_131.wav|21|The answer is maybe.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_328.wav|81|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_383.wav|26|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_297.wav|46|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_383.wav|85|Thousands of people were missing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_379.wav|65|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_221.wav|66|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_160.wav|11|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_225.wav|31|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_031.wav|31|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_276.wav|83|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_155.wav|83|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_163.wav|54|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_213.wav|87|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_137.wav|18|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_304.wav|67|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_007.wav|59|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_357.wav|67|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_196.wav|10|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_029.wav|79|The results were very clear.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_266.wav|75|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_069.wav|19|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_263.wav|8|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_370.wav|39|The value of the merger is still there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_066.wav|42|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_343.wav|44|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_181.wav|28|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_219.wav|11|History is made at the Masters.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_118.wav|87|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_097.wav|67|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_299.wav|56|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_235.wav|30|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_309.wav|105|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_084.wav|36|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_336.wav|98|Was it too obvious?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_239.wav|22|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_139.wav|7|I think he's the favourite, no question.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_333.wav|14|The people will not be patient.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_177.wav|28|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_341.wav|66|If there is default.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_311.wav|57|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_382.wav|11|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_307.wav|82|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_088.wav|51|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_251.wav|63|She claimed the day was for young people.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_107.wav|2|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_398.wav|40|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_183.wav|62|You're going to die.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_373.wav|15|We should not be complacent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_366.wav|67|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_216.wav|12|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_247.wav|66|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_166.wav|105|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_127.wav|38|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_382.wav|37|He did not say that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_283.wav|8|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_476.wav|14|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_395.wav|39|I was just happy to get my own goal.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_394.wav|77|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_411.wav|60|What she can't have is the money.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_395.wav|48|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_223.wav|38|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_018.wav|47|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_391.wav|26|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_256.wav|34|We are a new department.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_256.wav|11|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_351.wav|8|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_051.wav|91|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_383.wav|22|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_212.wav|90|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_239.wav|15|But the killing will continue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_350.wav|10|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_442.wav|39|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_092.wav|17|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_335.wav|10|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_288.wav|33|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_200.wav|29|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_184.wav|18|We know that from recent experience.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_246.wav|5|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_220.wav|98|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_078.wav|34|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_318.wav|60|I have learned a lot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_302.wav|85|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_231.wav|76|It was a stunning strike.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_203.wav|107|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_201.wav|81|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_420.wav|74|It was one New Year.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_005.wav|15|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_012.wav|46|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_186.wav|4|There will be no change in government.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_107.wav|15|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_120.wav|1|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_384.wav|62|It was only logical to end it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_038.wav|64|Too many factors are now working against him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_301.wav|27|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_043.wav|62|I think it must be the uniforms.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_329.wav|35|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_045.wav|3|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_402.wav|48|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_326.wav|94|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_233.wav|58|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p259/p259_206.wav|7|In due course we will make an announcement.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_100.wav|50|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_397.wav|11|You can't have both.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_088.wav|11|Now it has been eclipsed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_290.wav|80|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_479.wav|48|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_156.wav|1|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_408.wav|19|I want to keep him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_126.wav|94|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_195.wav|85|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_206.wav|57|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_010.wav|48|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_082.wav|42|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_117.wav|64|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_433.wav|106|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_014.wav|58|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_375.wav|87|He added, We are not prepared for war.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_021.wav|59|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_246.wav|51|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_013.wav|52|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_013.wav|81|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_261.wav|103|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_029.wav|90|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_054.wav|82|We will be paying agency rates.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_188.wav|19|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_091.wav|17|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_159.wav|85|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_469.wav|39|I just got under the ball a bit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_242.wav|89|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_239.wav|106|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_402.wav|60|There is so much at stake.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_162.wav|19|The General Election is all to play for.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_281.wav|10|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_370.wav|65|Neither had any other career.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_270.wav|67|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_420.wav|42|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_074.wav|106|He phoned the number in the brochure.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_243.wav|103|There is no change in our position.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_041.wav|13|She does not see anything ever changing.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_066.wav|90|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_230.wav|3|He intends to restart in the spring.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_402.wav|50|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_048.wav|23|Ferguson must take the blame.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_099.wav|39|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_010.wav|80|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_167.wav|20|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_283.wav|15|But it didn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_376.wav|55|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_361.wav|0|They have created a business.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_364.wav|47|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_026.wav|6|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_402.wav|89|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_259.wav|0|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_130.wav|53|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_111.wav|54|It's the way we go about it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_143.wav|69|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_051.wav|0|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_025.wav|37|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_083.wav|80|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_245.wav|92|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_042.wav|58|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_029.wav|62|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_374.wav|16|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_144.wav|102|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_142.wav|106|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_317.wav|46|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_085.wav|89|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_415.wav|50|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_083.wav|49|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_102.wav|97|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_199.wav|52|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_147.wav|18|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_287.wav|85|Who is to benefit from this change?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_095.wav|48|It was fun, but not a living.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_369.wav|25|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_196.wav|30|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_065.wav|67|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_302.wav|64|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_243.wav|10|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_097.wav|24|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_178.wav|97|A lot of things can go wrong.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_169.wav|28|It was a great team effort.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_210.wav|101|Scotland will play its part.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_389.wav|49|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_123.wav|21|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_331.wav|17|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_096.wav|92|We recognise it as a key area.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_185.wav|82|Death is outside the language.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_219.wav|14|Is it in the right place ?)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_026.wav|26|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_256.wav|92|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_200.wav|18|I'm very happy that it exploded.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_085.wav|77|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_364.wav|2|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_309.wav|106|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_190.wav|3|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_296.wav|46|Raised the way you want it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_459.wav|39|It goes with the job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_165.wav|15|We go back a long way.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_182.wav|45|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_250.wav|18|It was not like that at all.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_256.wav|66|Mind you, who wouldn't?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_278.wav|31|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_232.wav|28|Well, there is a bed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_332.wav|49|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_022.wav|43|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_223.wav|16|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_049.wav|71|"A recording contract is on the horizon."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_300.wav|3|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_122.wav|32|He said to give a local injection.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_412.wav|0|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_208.wav|90|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_347.wav|57|She is free.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_301.wav|59|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_298.wav|59|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_010.wav|99|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_345.wav|77|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_141.wav|58|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_348.wav|17|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_346.wav|37|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_045.wav|16|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_165.wav|107|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_369.wav|48|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_220.wav|30|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_155.wav|30|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_395.wav|97|It's a long-term solution.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_285.wav|81|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_122.wav|42|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_347.wav|53|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_242.wav|103|I leave tonight for England.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_153.wav|43|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_360.wav|27|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_082.wav|78|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_302.wav|45|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_152.wav|17|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_203.wav|83|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_338.wav|63|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_012.wav|14|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_012.wav|26|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_239.wav|82|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_045.wav|97|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_100.wav|7|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_382.wav|94|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_354.wav|19|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_045.wav|20|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_161.wav|36|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_310.wav|19|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_067.wav|16|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_419.wav|15|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_314.wav|92|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_354.wav|103|Their mind was already made up.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_267.wav|62|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_015.wav|63|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_269.wav|97|Do you want a cup of tea.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_219.wav|2|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_329.wav|104|Then it was into a series of classes.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_359.wav|5|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_172.wav|85|They must not succeed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_100.wav|66|I don't think it could be clearer.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_345.wav|94|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_333.wav|61|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_331.wav|5|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_275.wav|49|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_100.wav|91|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_249.wav|15|The door is open.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_097.wav|30|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_386.wav|29|I do not like to lose.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_082.wav|59|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_061.wav|39|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_136.wav|24|Failure is not an option.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_040.wav|98|It was pretty special.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_227.wav|41|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_327.wav|72|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_033.wav|12|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_246.wav|73|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_070.wav|26|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_216.wav|16|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_102.wav|62|They're just a nonsense.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_238.wav|98|But we must work in harmony.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_259.wav|2|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_081.wav|54|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_380.wav|34|He must be seen to be impartial.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_391.wav|47|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_262.wav|89|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_166.wav|103|We've been calling for a level playing field.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_314.wav|30|Tonight's matches European Championship.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_327.wav|59|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_320.wav|102|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_168.wav|53|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_040.wav|62|Not so, it transpires.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_400.wav|2|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_242.wav|79|It's to do with this place.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_182.wav|66|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_239.wav|14|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_109.wav|14|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_222.wav|84|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_263.wav|45|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_013.wav|45|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_396.wav|96|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_082.wav|86|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_346.wav|81|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_073.wav|26|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_022.wav|10|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_376.wav|29|Italy was just behind the US.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_267.wav|83|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_255.wav|47|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_462.wav|14|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_087.wav|74|But we never wanted to do that here.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_096.wav|0|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_089.wav|47|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_003.wav|27|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_355.wav|67|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_182.wav|16|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_102.wav|103|There is no guarantee.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_132.wav|28|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_351.wav|92|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_136.wav|93|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_113.wav|107|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_048.wav|61|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_205.wav|40|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_163.wav|99|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_010.wav|81|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_104.wav|96|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_369.wav|107|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_089.wav|51|He had a moustache.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_122.wav|33|We were not going to take that risk.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_208.wav|82|Everything has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_412.wav|36|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_017.wav|9|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_329.wav|86|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_303.wav|1|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_142.wav|9|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_419.wav|16|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_020.wav|32|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p283/p283_050.wav|95|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_343.wav|21|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_354.wav|47|There is no room for error.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_049.wav|74|It is somewhere to be.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_295.wav|21|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_350.wav|68|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_277.wav|74|I've done it all.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_003.wav|54|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_325.wav|59|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_328.wav|27|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_349.wav|58|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_318.wav|93|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_105.wav|20|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_011.wav|24|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_267.wav|44|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_091.wav|18|I decided to take my time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_190.wav|63|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_080.wav|95|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_111.wav|86|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_022.wav|105|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_067.wav|106|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_294.wav|87|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_375.wav|55|If you believe in the blue and white.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_144.wav|12|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_418.wav|48|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_220.wav|23|Who would be in that desert?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_305.wav|42|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_144.wav|22|This was not just incongruous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_389.wav|18|It is not designed to kill.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_326.wav|69|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_189.wav|17|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_046.wav|27|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_323.wav|39|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_286.wav|11|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_227.wav|24|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_177.wav|93|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_372.wav|47|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_172.wav|9|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_254.wav|76|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_011.wav|17|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_145.wav|105|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_219.wav|93|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_102.wav|21|I am not a doctor.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_025.wav|55|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_382.wav|100|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_261.wav|107|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_316.wav|38|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_177.wav|10|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_382.wav|106|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_379.wav|50|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_386.wav|92|That, however, is only part of the story.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_140.wav|81|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_006.wav|53|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_115.wav|26|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_180.wav|77|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_371.wav|84|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_402.wav|17|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_400.wav|66|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_408.wav|91|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_217.wav|50|He has a lot of skill.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_227.wav|51|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_148.wav|79|Or someone wants to say something different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_080.wav|61|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_310.wav|4|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_282.wav|27|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_151.wav|96|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_384.wav|23|I have chosen to do this research.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_319.wav|86|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_162.wav|33|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_242.wav|100|This is a family club.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_147.wav|44|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_126.wav|104|He has gone through the process before.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_339.wav|28|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_190.wav|18|They have the players to do it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_214.wav|18|We're not getting involved.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_328.wav|31|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_276.wav|54|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_174.wav|63|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_237.wav|38|After that it is up to the boss.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_128.wav|59|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_200.wav|25|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_161.wav|94|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_067.wav|72|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_472.wav|100|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_112.wav|22|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_102.wav|6|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_426.wav|36|The professor is in no doubt.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_123.wav|39|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_230.wav|9|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_019.wav|42|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_178.wav|34|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_098.wav|88|This is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_264.wav|82|It doesn't look good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_350.wav|59|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_285.wav|12|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_229.wav|98|She told me to stop.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_092.wav|68|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_027.wav|69|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_262.wav|6|Where was the point in all this?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_236.wav|94|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_019.wav|81|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_138.wav|66|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_217.wav|57|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_143.wav|12|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_200.wav|104|When it is ready, it will be signed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_146.wav|19|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_272.wav|12|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_013.wav|102|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_158.wav|34|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_126.wav|82|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_443.wav|50|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_295.wav|63|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_172.wav|33|He will be greatly missed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_178.wav|37|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_076.wav|42|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_277.wav|52|I think the shares are good value.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_062.wav|82|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_463.wav|65|That does not take much training.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_077.wav|82|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_344.wav|8|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_338.wav|84|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_069.wav|98|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_280.wav|69|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_076.wav|3|We can all make a mistake.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_394.wav|29|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_070.wav|69|They are real.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_350.wav|22|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_388.wav|39|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_207.wav|46|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_094.wav|72|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_413.wav|19|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_122.wav|106|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_392.wav|17|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_215.wav|87|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_001.wav|76|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_110.wav|26|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_246.wav|99|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_396.wav|4|She is fulfilled by it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_076.wav|103|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_329.wav|34|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_222.wav|72|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_089.wav|80|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_192.wav|14|I will have to order its destruction.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_202.wav|47|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_140.wav|45|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_418.wav|51|As for Owen, class is permanent.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_064.wav|99|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_308.wav|61|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_297.wav|18|The rest is his own.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_401.wav|11|Or so it seemed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_124.wav|19|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_026.wav|43|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_088.wav|88|The couple had one daughter.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_212.wav|45|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_350.wav|31|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_331.wav|72|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_117.wav|0|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_217.wav|47|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_128.wav|41|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_171.wav|48|Those three weeks are totally lost.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_269.wav|13|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_333.wav|9|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_358.wav|58|A review group will report on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_237.wav|92|We have seen the failure of politics.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_338.wav|73|That would help.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_101.wav|64|Happily we found it in the library.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_057.wav|78|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_205.wav|82|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_152.wav|76|I am ashamed of them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_227.wav|72|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_197.wav|46|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_364.wav|22|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_222.wav|57|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_313.wav|84|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_412.wav|107|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_357.wav|46|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_381.wav|48|We have not been approached.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_079.wav|63|Their mandate is to target inflation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_379.wav|20|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_297.wav|90|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_370.wav|58|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_023.wav|93|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_278.wav|21|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_051.wav|57|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_154.wav|72|This is our Olympics.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_039.wav|59|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_087.wav|106|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_214.wav|44|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_376.wav|40|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_153.wav|16|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_195.wav|100|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_016.wav|23|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_116.wav|79|You should enjoy the day.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_184.wav|64|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_101.wav|67|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_381.wav|51|He had no answer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_236.wav|29|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_067.wav|52|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_319.wav|39|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_161.wav|6|I feel a little betrayed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_349.wav|40|She is free.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_170.wav|86|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_356.wav|74|But he did not appear.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_402.wav|11|I will have to think about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_110.wav|51|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_237.wav|26|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_230.wav|77|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_404.wav|18|I'm delighted with our performance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_061.wav|24|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_329.wav|60|He has changed my life forever.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_359.wav|51|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_064.wav|30|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_297.wav|83|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_411.wav|47|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_232.wav|104|I'm not a little girl.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_158.wav|2|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_048.wav|64|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_010.wav|45|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_348.wav|13|It gives us something to work on.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_274.wav|95|That takes a lot of courage.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_120.wav|14|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_345.wav|53|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_207.wav|60|The baby was dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_073.wav|50|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_102.wav|13|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_092.wav|93|She told The Herald.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_131.wav|95|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_008.wav|59|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_103.wav|9|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_193.wav|39|I thought he did very well.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_232.wav|91|That's the key issue isn't it?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_088.wav|50|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_100.wav|11|I want to be there by right.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_084.wav|41|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_233.wav|66|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_029.wav|1|That was their attitude.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_244.wav|9|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_296.wav|11|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_021.wav|91|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_042.wav|70|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_198.wav|45|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_281.wav|32|This will look at consumer attitudes.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_198.wav|5|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_336.wav|19|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_216.wav|24|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_374.wav|46|They were only there for three weeks.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_379.wav|77|I do not like to lose.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_226.wav|74|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_457.wav|36|The men are very worried.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_249.wav|70|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_355.wav|19|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_071.wav|74|They do not deliver.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_231.wav|93|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_088.wav|0|It's for that reason he should resign.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_209.wav|49|That has not changed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_213.wav|18|It has certainly paid off for him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_381.wav|100|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_424.wav|98|This is a matter of life and death.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_360.wav|66|Nobody ever gets to see them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_258.wav|34|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_329.wav|82|His father said, My son was lucky.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_189.wav|93|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_385.wav|27|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_361.wav|25|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_148.wav|10|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_026.wav|9|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_008.wav|51|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_085.wav|5|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_346.wav|96|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_039.wav|98|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_307.wav|10|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_052.wav|17|I fell to the ground.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_045.wav|107|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_136.wav|59|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_102.wav|100|We are also looking for new licences.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_077.wav|25|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_066.wav|51|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_378.wav|76|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_186.wav|18|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_232.wav|103|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_156.wav|76|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_105.wav|68|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_264.wav|55|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_158.wav|47|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_327.wav|57|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_406.wav|27|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_116.wav|3|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_311.wav|32|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_140.wav|14|This is the highlight of my career.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_004.wav|82|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_356.wav|16|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_027.wav|50|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_258.wav|95|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_138.wav|103|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_201.wav|53|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_055.wav|25|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_125.wav|37|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_011.wav|100|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_188.wav|0|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_350.wav|91|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_344.wav|96|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_337.wav|32|There will be good prospects ahead.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_095.wav|53|He will be a very hard act to follow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_284.wav|22|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_264.wav|61|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_295.wav|93|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_199.wav|21|Or so it is hoped.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_004.wav|46|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_196.wav|79|They will be very physical.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_275.wav|64|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_158.wav|65|We have come a long way since then.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_378.wav|33|They promised to fight the plans.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_099.wav|17|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_088.wav|90|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_296.wav|13|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_317.wav|75|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_043.wav|84|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_024.wav|55|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_309.wav|53|It happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_117.wav|37|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_146.wav|97|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_274.wav|63|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_185.wav|5|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_096.wav|49|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_051.wav|44|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_073.wav|89|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_391.wav|74|The children are fine.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_358.wav|5|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_006.wav|25|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_198.wav|93|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_165.wav|70|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_019.wav|4|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_066.wav|30|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_272.wav|52|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_045.wav|52|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_176.wav|81|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_134.wav|80|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_154.wav|86|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_203.wav|65|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_462.wav|106|It was very positive and very helpful.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_215.wav|70|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_195.wav|48|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_397.wav|19|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_437.wav|24|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_112.wav|88|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_394.wav|70|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_444.wav|32|They are interior designers and architects.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_138.wav|89|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_274.wav|30|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_097.wav|68|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_417.wav|7|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_285.wav|32|None of this work is guaranteed.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_019.wav|14|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p318/p318_290.wav|19|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_263.wav|32|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_317.wav|53|He will just go on doing his job.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_199.wav|81|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_224.wav|41|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_036.wav|50|But he can turn on the charm.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_033.wav|76|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_286.wav|34|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_021.wav|27|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_122.wav|46|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_252.wav|53|The rise has come too late for some.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_086.wav|104|We have to focus on what is important.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_227.wav|104|Are we going mainstream?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_223.wav|35|How do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_360.wav|56|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_284.wav|106|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_206.wav|18|It is part of our heritage.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_374.wav|50|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_072.wav|43|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_283.wav|51|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_147.wav|98|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_171.wav|107|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_389.wav|6|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_116.wav|26|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_093.wav|78|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_203.wav|94|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_309.wav|20|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_322.wav|84|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_436.wav|65|It was a hard fight.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_184.wav|103|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_142.wav|54|Other people also tried.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_196.wav|49|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_466.wav|63|He was backed by Downing Street.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_187.wav|19|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_282.wav|20|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_382.wav|53|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_326.wav|67|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_323.wav|3|And he's the real thing.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_072.wav|21|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_155.wav|27|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_399.wav|66|Things are going very well.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_201.wav|90|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_357.wav|37|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_085.wav|61|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p257/p257_427.wav|105|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_123.wav|19|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_423.wav|56|That means that nobody can do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_266.wav|83|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_352.wav|38|You have to audition for jobs.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_292.wav|10|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_404.wav|38|We are going to change our party.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_360.wav|19|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_341.wav|105|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_186.wav|37|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_135.wav|52|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_469.wav|50|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_329.wav|32|I was brought up in a mining background.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_237.wav|72|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_186.wav|72|Or is it the European approach?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_290.wav|7|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_032.wav|60|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_403.wav|68|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_019.wav|68|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_213.wav|107|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_456.wav|36|We could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_159.wav|2|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_375.wav|31|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_321.wav|77|I have signed a contract.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_114.wav|41|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_020.wav|37|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_317.wav|1|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_002.wav|74|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_093.wav|44|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_204.wav|19|Election results are expected soon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_318.wav|29|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_205.wav|11|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_240.wav|51|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_245.wav|23|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_348.wav|78|We never played at all.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_400.wav|22|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_289.wav|107|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_190.wav|8|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_435.wav|48|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_376.wav|53|It used to be all hard sell.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_437.wav|100|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_212.wav|26|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_247.wav|41|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_071.wav|63|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_176.wav|0|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_053.wav|41|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_074.wav|10|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_219.wav|32|People should make their own decisions.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_377.wav|48|Commitment is released on Liberty.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_087.wav|15|One is investment, one is reform.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_087.wav|75|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_395.wav|100|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_155.wav|31|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_163.wav|10|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_428.wav|50|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_304.wav|54|His signature is his handwriting.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_326.wav|10|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_057.wav|107|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_289.wav|72|What are the barriers?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_394.wav|54|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_188.wav|70|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_082.wav|105|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_218.wav|13|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_154.wav|34|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_039.wav|7|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_200.wav|43|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_144.wav|51|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_042.wav|88|Since then it has become a tradition.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_027.wav|76|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_323.wav|52|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_343.wav|38|He's a key player in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_170.wav|55|The second failed completely.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_088.wav|1|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_232.wav|60|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_231.wav|27|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_289.wav|66|We are aware of the two incidents.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_076.wav|31|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_418.wav|50|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_004.wav|58|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_266.wav|71|"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_275.wav|50|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_298.wav|78|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_129.wav|50|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_015.wav|102|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_124.wav|42|United were in control without always being dominant.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_199.wav|58|I'm not afraid of that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_410.wav|62|He supported the decision to review the decision.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_155.wav|57|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_356.wav|4|I hope they will understand the reasons.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_263.wav|67|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_041.wav|32|He looks like an Afghan.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_298.wav|14|They were worth the money.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_022.wav|90|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_087.wav|48|He has really done well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_228.wav|95|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_179.wav|17|The club are feeling no different today.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_083.wav|47|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_197.wav|17|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_304.wav|38|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_285.wav|104|He had asked if they had the script.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_241.wav|78|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_411.wav|34|We are seeking funds from government departments.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_214.wav|30|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_399.wav|4|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_382.wav|67|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_385.wav|2|They deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_361.wav|40|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_018.wav|32|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p252/p252_397.wav|55|He has worked hard over the years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_007.wav|38|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_335.wav|72|This has come as a shock to everyone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_061.wav|35|But the challenge is in the US.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_349.wav|67|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_028.wav|66|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_281.wav|88|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_156.wav|49|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_141.wav|28|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_249.wav|87|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_395.wav|27|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_006.wav|60|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_084.wav|23|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_091.wav|105|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_265.wav|66|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_342.wav|25|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_430.wav|27|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_290.wav|55|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_055.wav|0|So I liked the challenge.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_091.wav|81|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_314.wav|101|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_395.wav|65|We learned two things.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_066.wav|104|What kind of inclusion is that?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_445.wav|8|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_071.wav|9|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_090.wav|34|You are not in any kind of trouble.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_362.wav|98|I am a player.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_113.wav|41|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_056.wav|44|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_167.wav|52|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_130.wav|87|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_304.wav|5|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_040.wav|99|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_143.wav|70|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_321.wav|80|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_244.wav|45|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_356.wav|39|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_155.wav|65|The second failed completely.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_162.wav|91|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_173.wav|63|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_247.wav|49|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_261.wav|60|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_399.wav|102|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_026.wav|25|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_363.wav|69|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_237.wav|64|There were two things going on at once.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_039.wav|45|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_282.wav|90|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_367.wav|84|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_367.wav|76|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_100.wav|46|But who shot the president?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_202.wav|43|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_244.wav|63|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_025.wav|45|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_381.wav|33|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_013.wav|70|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_100.wav|37|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_026.wav|22|They changed the world of music.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_220.wav|102|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_032.wav|87|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_113.wav|51|This would not be my first choice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_113.wav|60|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_408.wav|76|I want to keep him.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_196.wav|107|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_264.wav|16|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_119.wav|84|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_284.wav|56|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_138.wav|24|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_171.wav|87|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_172.wav|54|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_429.wav|75|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_013.wav|69|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_138.wav|48|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_250.wav|34|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_035.wav|99|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_377.wav|28|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_019.wav|102|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_091.wav|11|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_340.wav|93|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_200.wav|42|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_206.wav|8|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_197.wav|33|We expect a full house on the night.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_025.wav|85|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_316.wav|79|I'd never given up on myself.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_116.wav|28|What she will do next?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_416.wav|17|They've been here before.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_134.wav|73|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_101.wav|17|Construction is due to begin in February.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_348.wav|66|The urgency is real.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_003.wav|26|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_123.wav|94|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_281.wav|16|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_017.wav|97|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_261.wav|87|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_003.wav|11|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_389.wav|36|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_403.wav|10|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_227.wav|107|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_075.wav|65|That is really all.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_306.wav|33|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_290.wav|0|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_391.wav|66|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_456.wav|95|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_137.wav|20|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_339.wav|29|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_073.wav|96|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_330.wav|70|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_331.wav|31|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_211.wav|50|They are looking at flotation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_071.wav|85|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_194.wav|31|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_251.wav|49|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_205.wav|64|It has come as a bombshell.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_374.wav|105|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_427.wav|75|It is a case of pity for us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_339.wav|56|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_423.wav|50|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_005.wav|5|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_253.wav|69|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_292.wav|40|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_337.wav|53|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_121.wav|41|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_226.wav|41|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_209.wav|57|Who will pay for this ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_371.wav|85|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_014.wav|1|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_185.wav|9|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_367.wav|100|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_318.wav|6|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_018.wav|11|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_238.wav|80|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_007.wav|48|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_379.wav|107|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_281.wav|3|I had to be into it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_110.wav|55|He gets his moment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_070.wav|73|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_007.wav|74|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_132.wav|66|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_142.wav|92|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_078.wav|39|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_380.wav|20|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_085.wav|6|It was that kind of war.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_285.wav|101|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_153.wav|26|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_375.wav|2|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_070.wav|67|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_175.wav|49|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_230.wav|99|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_219.wav|61|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_326.wav|98|We have great support.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_296.wav|96|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_119.wav|102|Completion is expected by October the following year.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_013.wav|5|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_300.wav|59|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_326.wav|70|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_077.wav|68|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_209.wav|82|The Lobby is not failing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_160.wav|96|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_086.wav|24|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_148.wav|45|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_212.wav|10|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_009.wav|79|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_065.wav|80|You did not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_063.wav|34|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_225.wav|11|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_311.wav|72|It is a potential factor.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_017.wav|106|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_310.wav|44|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_127.wav|106|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_407.wav|39|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_456.wav|14|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_155.wav|71|"We also enjoyed a lot of support."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_151.wav|63|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_343.wav|70|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_166.wav|18|My condition is not bad.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_076.wav|105|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_356.wav|102|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_100.wav|48|Sales are falling after years of growth.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_186.wav|102|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_253.wav|98|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_323.wav|31|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_315.wav|77|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_389.wav|47|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_141.wav|60|That was the theory.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_250.wav|9|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_384.wav|14|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_410.wav|52|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_001.wav|51|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_167.wav|45|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_151.wav|81|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_078.wav|25|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_155.wav|42|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_278.wav|35|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_254.wav|47|It is very important that we get the balance right.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_274.wav|83|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_274.wav|25|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_217.wav|81|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_325.wav|50|Have a look at this lot.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_115.wav|91|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_287.wav|45|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_122.wav|30|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_096.wav|15|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_110.wav|17|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_346.wav|94|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_203.wav|7|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_291.wav|101|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_026.wav|30|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_149.wav|103|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_257.wav|96|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_082.wav|96|What has changed ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_170.wav|2|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_092.wav|41|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_415.wav|106|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_282.wav|16|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_323.wav|85|Is that not uncanny?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_273.wav|102|The board has rejected her proposals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_072.wav|105|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_054.wav|31|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_258.wav|94|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_028.wav|100|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_117.wav|32|We had another last Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_138.wav|79|We needed someone and we now have him.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_123.wav|105|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_304.wav|1|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_121.wav|36|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_158.wav|26|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_152.wav|65|Did it work?)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_298.wav|8|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_247.wav|103|We must learn from the past.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_167.wav|3|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_146.wav|107|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_260.wav|24|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_174.wav|101|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_144.wav|96|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_310.wav|90|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_209.wav|94|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_261.wav|70|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_046.wav|72|You have to have a sense of humour.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_121.wav|68|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_150.wav|100|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_111.wav|16|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_306.wav|6|It is not just in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_222.wav|77|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_443.wav|95|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_277.wav|73|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_239.wav|43|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_175.wav|43|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_203.wav|63|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_259.wav|29|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_009.wav|100|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_358.wav|95|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_085.wav|2|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_360.wav|52|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_017.wav|0|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_190.wav|97|It's a drop in the bucket.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_249.wav|23|Nobody has been put on trial.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_381.wav|63|She is obviously very disappointed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_041.wav|47|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_356.wav|33|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_127.wav|90|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_267.wav|39|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_247.wav|1|They are also exploited by the markets.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_042.wav|73|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_191.wav|15|I think he's done it a few times.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_264.wav|25|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_051.wav|23|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_158.wav|82|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_431.wav|100|That's the way it works.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_256.wav|81|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_421.wav|16|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_219.wav|35|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_390.wav|17|I didn't actually believe them at first.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_174.wav|71|"This is a sad day."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_336.wav|2|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_337.wav|72|It is not for me, though.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_376.wav|14|That is a crazy situation.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_385.wav|54|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_064.wav|95|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_292.wav|33|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_280.wav|20|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_113.wav|62|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_299.wav|54|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_201.wav|28|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_408.wav|20|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_120.wav|76|The Tory party will last.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_140.wav|5|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_070.wav|87|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_359.wav|105|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_045.wav|93|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_139.wav|32|It is a vicious circle.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_209.wav|37|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_064.wav|61|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_286.wav|19|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_385.wav|62|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_094.wav|8|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_267.wav|65|I was totally wrong.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_110.wav|11|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_401.wav|105|She is superb.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_363.wav|83|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_167.wav|100|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_374.wav|84|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_170.wav|85|None of the opinions is good.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_356.wav|82|We had a good time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_091.wav|58|There is a growing anger among the group.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_190.wav|2|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_320.wav|55|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_271.wav|102|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_298.wav|83|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_159.wav|13|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_312.wav|97|He confirmed there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_355.wav|101|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_190.wav|48|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_313.wav|13|This means a great deal to the families.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_019.wav|48|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_198.wav|27|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_110.wav|16|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_207.wav|9|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_250.wav|71|"The pensioners did not want to know."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_452.wav|95|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_316.wav|91|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_385.wav|85|It's time to move on.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_357.wav|106|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_191.wav|50|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_243.wav|15|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_141.wav|81|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_025.wav|48|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_155.wav|67|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_395.wav|0|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_250.wav|64|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_177.wav|83|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_277.wav|106|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_347.wav|81|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_370.wav|96|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_161.wav|2|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_408.wav|34|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_197.wav|48|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_405.wav|25|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_034.wav|35|He really is a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_146.wav|76|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_464.wav|7|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_252.wav|54|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_367.wav|104|Cooking is intricate and complex.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_167.wav|90|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_339.wav|83|She is free.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_399.wav|100|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_117.wav|101|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_196.wav|4|They were kept there for a summer.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_126.wav|18|That imbalance was evident in their play.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_133.wav|52|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_415.wav|34|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_362.wav|72|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_032.wav|63|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_060.wav|12|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_210.wav|81|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_345.wav|79|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_402.wav|20|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_407.wav|37|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_353.wav|39|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_200.wav|56|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_330.wav|0|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_085.wav|1|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_359.wav|18|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_150.wav|46|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_054.wav|101|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_193.wav|57|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_089.wav|19|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_088.wav|53|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_037.wav|4|They did a very good job.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_077.wav|36|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_273.wav|98|I didn't expect to be in.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_140.wav|70|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_415.wav|60|Now, she will not be running at all.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_045.wav|51|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_061.wav|6|He is not alone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_280.wav|56|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_095.wav|96|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_059.wav|71|"It will take time."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_069.wav|23|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_132.wav|100|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_264.wav|99|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_173.wav|34|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_313.wav|85|How would it work?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_149.wav|11|And so it should.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_033.wav|36|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_009.wav|92|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_391.wav|102|Form and structure are his music.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_049.wav|35|We have to bring in new players.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_170.wav|26|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_069.wav|82|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_016.wav|26|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_077.wav|55|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_159.wav|15|You never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_072.wav|63|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_221.wav|70|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_323.wav|51|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_381.wav|62|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_183.wav|50|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_042.wav|38|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_336.wav|33|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_207.wav|81|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_144.wav|100|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_332.wav|76|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_324.wav|21|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_081.wav|47|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_362.wav|79|He could have given them a lot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_241.wav|98|Everyone must be focused on the league.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_117.wav|53|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_027.wav|73|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_127.wav|96|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_173.wav|76|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_381.wav|32|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_275.wav|25|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_073.wav|76|It really has left the town in shock.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_045.wav|83|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_025.wav|0|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_258.wav|90|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_267.wav|56|The demand is created by the supply.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_400.wav|28|It had until tomorrow to comply.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_287.wav|65|He followed the Italian route.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_420.wav|18|I am also delighted for all the players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_225.wav|56|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_178.wav|95|The woman was his wife.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_264.wav|32|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_268.wav|79|He is not the only one.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_232.wav|97|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_233.wav|84|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_052.wav|55|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_017.wav|7|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p273/p273_208.wav|56|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_342.wav|36|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_089.wav|33|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_147.wav|106|We just have to adapt.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_077.wav|69|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_016.wav|11|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_119.wav|40|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_389.wav|45|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_391.wav|62|The only safe investment is cash.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_257.wav|87|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_421.wav|33|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_071.wav|106|Let's not be too despondent.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_290.wav|40|I could never be cool.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_287.wav|18|What do you want.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_222.wav|28|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_420.wav|33|We will be pleased to talk to them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_289.wav|82|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_108.wav|1|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_195.wav|87|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_387.wav|97|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_142.wav|23|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_042.wav|13|It doesn't come any better than this.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_195.wav|61|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_105.wav|40|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_299.wav|27|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_108.wav|19|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_095.wav|61|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_393.wav|56|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_127.wav|71|"It will be too hot."
DUMMY2/p244/p244_218.wav|78|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_069.wav|21|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_189.wav|91|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_301.wav|50|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_216.wav|21|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_166.wav|34|There are so many people to thank.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_110.wav|95|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_393.wav|95|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_280.wav|70|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_343.wav|18|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_361.wav|95|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_145.wav|44|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_354.wav|105|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_141.wav|72|This advice was accepted by ministers.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_132.wav|95|We would make a start.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_356.wav|99|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_114.wav|32|It was a good game to watch.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_338.wav|77|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_202.wav|62|I believe that the answer is simple.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_139.wav|87|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_250.wav|62|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_027.wav|21|We will be back next year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_233.wav|57|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_260.wav|26|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_130.wav|58|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_007.wav|18|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_232.wav|29|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_108.wav|52|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_234.wav|55|We know the problems.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_019.wav|31|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_044.wav|52|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_316.wav|54|It is still holding good today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_225.wav|33|I think it is a scandal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_101.wav|21|We can only go up.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_045.wav|40|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_207.wav|10|It was a horrible thing to happen.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_141.wav|2|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_364.wav|26|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_017.wav|44|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_409.wav|47|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_421.wav|20|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_365.wav|25|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_216.wav|37|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_096.wav|91|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_047.wav|64|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_358.wav|96|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_074.wav|62|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_364.wav|50|It is not real life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_370.wav|56|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_127.wav|18|However, the drama was not over.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_156.wav|63|He's not a Celtic man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_287.wav|103|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_185.wav|83|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_021.wav|107|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_198.wav|35|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_374.wav|103|But we could not change his mind.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_110.wav|35|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_339.wav|96|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_374.wav|91|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_390.wav|49|It's really nothing new.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_100.wav|9|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_177.wav|58|His signature is his handwriting.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_409.wav|1|You guys are not out of it yet.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_035.wav|48|I might well have done so already.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_405.wav|62|This is my big break.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_153.wav|76|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_317.wav|100|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_222.wav|99|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_174.wav|6|The only trouble is finding them.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_081.wav|26|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_423.wav|8|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_027.wav|85|Have we tried everything?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_044.wav|66|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_152.wav|32|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_097.wav|37|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_309.wav|85|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_387.wav|23|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_260.wav|49|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_188.wav|13|One of these problems is the railways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_392.wav|82|It was a game we had to win.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_318.wav|34|This rule is archaic.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_163.wav|30|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_059.wav|20|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_354.wav|93|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_160.wav|69|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_228.wav|76|And then a funny thing happened.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_069.wav|3|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_003.wav|71|"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  "
DUMMY2/p248/p248_238.wav|99|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_237.wav|28|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_220.wav|100|It has been like that all year for me.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_113.wav|56|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_117.wav|88|It was an important part of the course.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_100.wav|76|They've just got to believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_390.wav|50|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_239.wav|30|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_048.wav|60|Is he conscious?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_355.wav|39|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_194.wav|4|Nobody could survive on that.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_305.wav|51|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_174.wav|46|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_189.wav|78|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_043.wav|53|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_344.wav|100|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_210.wav|30|I was surprised by his response.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_012.wav|61|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_394.wav|106|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_061.wav|2|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_403.wav|24|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_008.wav|54|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_252.wav|61|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_004.wav|45|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_184.wav|59|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_060.wav|10|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_225.wav|93|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_221.wav|0|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_303.wav|62|Destruction came from within.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_158.wav|54|We are asking the council to think again.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_069.wav|35|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_331.wav|52|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_085.wav|94|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_252.wav|66|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_312.wav|26|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_194.wav|26|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_191.wav|83|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_214.wav|7|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_098.wav|2|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_037.wav|77|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_307.wav|49|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_152.wav|72|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_012.wav|45|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_230.wav|86|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_221.wav|26|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_335.wav|25|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_352.wav|42|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_114.wav|94|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_182.wav|57|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_458.wav|63|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_046.wav|100|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_018.wav|80|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_174.wav|38|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_160.wav|8|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_238.wav|90|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_005.wav|4|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_223.wav|15|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_341.wav|44|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_214.wav|74|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_079.wav|13|It was very full anyway.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_273.wav|50|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_036.wav|62|Now the show is for public consumption.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_077.wav|54|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_347.wav|98|She becomes a mother.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_362.wav|49|It feels like too much.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_314.wav|10|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_298.wav|7|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_341.wav|80|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_069.wav|37|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_079.wav|77|That was a great performance by the team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_016.wav|78|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_267.wav|47|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_431.wav|56|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_293.wav|81|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_117.wav|106|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_134.wav|46|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_341.wav|57|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_031.wav|13|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_380.wav|15|We are not getting him back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_204.wav|24|We are going through difficult times.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_059.wav|13|I was completely knackered.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_414.wav|77|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_045.wav|82|We would certainly consider the proposals.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_073.wav|18|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_402.wav|70|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_193.wav|17|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_101.wav|87|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_348.wav|82|I just know it's a lot.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_318.wav|49|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_105.wav|34|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_316.wav|66|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_218.wav|86|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_233.wav|16|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_349.wav|91|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_129.wav|81|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_394.wav|16|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_159.wav|44|The inquiry had been going on for months.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_268.wav|29|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_263.wav|4|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_108.wav|27|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_129.wav|1|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_319.wav|8|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_306.wav|31|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_060.wav|46|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_392.wav|18|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_016.wav|45|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_244.wav|104|They are not suitable.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_096.wav|54|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_250.wav|4|It's time to say enough is enough.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_002.wav|39|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_379.wav|95|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_295.wav|4|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_019.wav|84|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_224.wav|7|Little is known about them.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_296.wav|74|I thought the dancing was over.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_225.wav|42|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_007.wav|2|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_283.wav|67|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_216.wav|100|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_083.wav|13|Among them is his beloved teacher.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_418.wav|27|That may be.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_220.wav|105|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_071.wav|32|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_098.wav|28|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_296.wav|92|We're not really commenting on that.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_340.wav|36|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_024.wav|63|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_293.wav|22|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_372.wav|98|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_095.wav|98|I believe in trade unions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_254.wav|12|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_184.wav|31|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p265/p265_005.wav|73|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_390.wav|62|It is part and parcel of it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_148.wav|36|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_247.wav|69|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_409.wav|11|I certainly will not settle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_311.wav|6|There is another side to it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_181.wav|73|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_233.wav|46|It is a big time for me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_421.wav|14|He seems to be used to the attention.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_145.wav|59|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_338.wav|3|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_026.wav|42|We have gone on about him no end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_255.wav|49|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_447.wav|37|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_010.wav|97|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_274.wav|67|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_282.wav|87|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_235.wav|40|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_153.wav|101|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_342.wav|13|I had to win this race.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_159.wav|17|It's never the same problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_207.wav|47|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_245.wav|54|How could anyone take issue with that?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_191.wav|77|It is hard to tell.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_023.wav|9|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_214.wav|40|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_080.wav|107|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_242.wav|75|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_307.wav|6|It's never happened before.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_039.wav|83|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_182.wav|105|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_402.wav|18|The first appeared to be successful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_101.wav|15|This is complete nonsense.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_407.wav|76|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_274.wav|89|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_299.wav|101|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_002.wav|86|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_149.wav|59|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_345.wav|97|That never seemed likely.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_189.wav|84|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_061.wav|16|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_155.wav|5|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_251.wav|29|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_292.wav|73|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_090.wav|76|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_330.wav|34|It was very well received.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_285.wav|61|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_380.wav|77|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_172.wav|86|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_088.wav|34|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_041.wav|100|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_169.wav|29|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_234.wav|7|I am delighted for Simon.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_033.wav|60|It's something which is very important to me.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_325.wav|92|We're very close to making it in Europe.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_257.wav|80|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_264.wav|62|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_296.wav|58|There were so many characters among them.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_089.wav|81|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_233.wav|85|It doesn't look good for her.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_240.wav|97|For example they could be in school uniform.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_293.wav|3|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_104.wav|25|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_325.wav|14|His only reply was a laugh.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_221.wav|55|The labour side had developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_150.wav|50|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_410.wav|4|This will be no easy option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_448.wav|7|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_193.wav|27|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_057.wav|53|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_063.wav|13|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_002.wav|61|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_165.wav|25|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_070.wav|50|This is an exciting new venture.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_276.wav|95|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_107.wav|32|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_055.wav|88|The president took offence.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_324.wav|67|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_292.wav|69|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_310.wav|28|We will meet again.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_327.wav|86|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_251.wav|87|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_404.wav|87|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_099.wav|38|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_309.wav|88|We're talking to him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_211.wav|94|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_178.wav|105|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_097.wav|95|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_381.wav|92|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_418.wav|76|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_324.wav|14|I was brought up in a mining background.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_396.wav|98|And then he laughs.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_301.wav|86|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_096.wav|31|Get to know him.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_132.wav|74|Who do you think will win?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_375.wav|52|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_007.wav|67|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_424.wav|17|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_216.wav|39|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_305.wav|78|There was a hole in it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_251.wav|80|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_147.wav|95|And I have some advice for my old friend.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_210.wav|12|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_086.wav|7|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_328.wav|52|He is not exactly a pretty child.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_101.wav|7|I did not have a bet on myself.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_355.wav|85|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_368.wav|74|Things are on track.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_135.wav|17|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_336.wav|3|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_291.wav|51|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_414.wav|4|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_181.wav|90|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_015.wav|21|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_147.wav|82|It plainly does not work.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_337.wav|102|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_144.wav|46|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_193.wav|11|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_345.wav|6|One was taken to hospital.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_071.wav|15|We have to move forward from now on.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_431.wav|48|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_228.wav|38|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_417.wav|54|We've still got a say in this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_012.wav|52|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_211.wav|20|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_235.wav|39|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_203.wav|89|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_050.wav|39|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_107.wav|23|They will now have to justify their position.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_162.wav|107|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_210.wav|60|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_241.wav|16|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_409.wav|85|Taxation should be simplified.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_330.wav|12|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_164.wav|55|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_300.wav|107|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_100.wav|87|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_053.wav|69|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_001.wav|22|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_196.wav|90|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_399.wav|1|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_325.wav|22|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_208.wav|88|I am really, really happy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_332.wav|51|No, no, it's not what you think.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_214.wav|19|We are a party for people, not against people.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_053.wav|23|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_344.wav|73|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_071.wav|27|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_230.wav|31|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_366.wav|48|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_402.wav|65|They have quick front players, but so do we.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_116.wav|29|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_177.wav|60|Was the punishment excessive?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_098.wav|106|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_023.wav|15|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_114.wav|85|She has the biggest part.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_363.wav|31|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_272.wav|36|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_033.wav|81|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_080.wav|69|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_264.wav|26|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_145.wav|77|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_340.wav|1|It would have to be backdated.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_268.wav|64|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_313.wav|99|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_045.wav|44|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_061.wav|82|The classes are taking place.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_091.wav|103|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_262.wav|25|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_033.wav|83|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_230.wav|18|It has to be put in context.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_183.wav|15|He is appealing to women.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_021.wav|71|"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "
DUMMY2/p256/p256_271.wav|90|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_247.wav|32|There were no reports of casualties.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_260.wav|64|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_330.wav|102|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_118.wav|62|It's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_381.wav|28|Therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_360.wav|49|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_015.wav|36|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_204.wav|89|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_024.wav|37|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_389.wav|15|I am not a frustrated actor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_262.wav|23|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_294.wav|27|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_353.wav|6|I only found out about it this morning.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_198.wav|20|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_030.wav|27|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_180.wav|32|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_381.wav|84|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_318.wav|91|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_278.wav|44|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_247.wav|42|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_068.wav|57|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_249.wav|77|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_429.wav|106|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_218.wav|60|That's a big reduction.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_317.wav|93|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_261.wav|58|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_333.wav|58|I have a bunch of veterans.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_210.wav|2|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_241.wav|66|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_056.wav|13|I find the whole affair disturbing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_122.wav|10|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_192.wav|29|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_096.wav|72|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_085.wav|46|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_184.wav|63|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_030.wav|30|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_383.wav|82|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_326.wav|103|There was barely a handful of chances.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_133.wav|36|First meeting was next week.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_041.wav|27|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_293.wav|56|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_110.wav|31|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_154.wav|90|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_397.wav|56|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_066.wav|87|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_134.wav|10|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_021.wav|55|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_092.wav|26|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_341.wav|60|There will be no backing down.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_256.wav|61|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_226.wav|13|I don't think that's very fair.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_175.wav|8|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_338.wav|105|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_377.wav|67|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_158.wav|24|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_059.wav|62|The trust has no magic wand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_017.wav|73|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_083.wav|91|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_116.wav|10|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_049.wav|106|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_413.wav|0|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_316.wav|15|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_450.wav|100|You have to see the work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_124.wav|31|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_071.wav|36|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_363.wav|38|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_423.wav|19|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_101.wav|86|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_141.wav|83|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_375.wav|22|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_325.wav|11|It will never happen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_013.wav|82|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_121.wav|96|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_050.wav|94|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_306.wav|94|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_165.wav|23|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_040.wav|16|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_025.wav|83|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_322.wav|20|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_345.wav|51|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_113.wav|90|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_003.wav|0|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_296.wav|94|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_373.wav|99|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_251.wav|72|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_409.wav|10|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_360.wav|69|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_003.wav|77|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_308.wav|6|It was a deeper deception.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_073.wav|13|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_265.wav|47|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_359.wav|48|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_364.wav|95|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_269.wav|18|They have to live with the risk.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_252.wav|47|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_142.wav|29|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_320.wav|24|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_417.wav|107|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_212.wav|32|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_177.wav|101|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_278.wav|17|Well, when did he ever refuse?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_382.wav|92|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_177.wav|57|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_337.wav|58|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_205.wav|80|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_044.wav|33|Who are the democrats?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_122.wav|50|We should not be surprised.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_113.wav|38|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_083.wav|84|They were badly prepared for it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_067.wav|95|This is the year of the Tiger.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_378.wav|75|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_258.wav|96|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_187.wav|43|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_030.wav|10|The director will be present.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_157.wav|34|I've never seen them down here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_103.wav|15|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_434.wav|89|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_168.wav|19|This one is a special case.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_008.wav|31|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_242.wav|95|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_103.wav|82|This is his personal life.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_050.wav|103|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_343.wav|83|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_200.wav|53|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_063.wav|33|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_177.wav|52|It's just a different way of life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_401.wav|33|I am very excited about this season.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_213.wav|69|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_028.wav|14|Because we do not need it.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_187.wav|20|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_423.wav|79|That was only the start.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_046.wav|13|That was not due to me.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_075.wav|16|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_091.wav|77|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_047.wav|22|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_114.wav|1|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_297.wav|97|It would then be up to the judge.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_031.wav|60|There are two problems.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_240.wav|66|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_400.wav|102|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_231.wav|16|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_162.wav|94|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_079.wav|94|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_304.wav|56|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_274.wav|94|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_206.wav|80|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_233.wav|18|No, they have played well.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_145.wav|101|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_026.wav|63|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_053.wav|1|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_353.wav|17|That is of no use.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_360.wav|54|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_348.wav|42|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_316.wav|68|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_341.wav|34|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_186.wav|22|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_399.wav|27|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_220.wav|55|There is no doubt there's room for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_357.wav|74|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_168.wav|8|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_207.wav|68|The line-up is a tasty one.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_105.wav|94|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_321.wav|28|Family, if you like.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_068.wav|5|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_041.wav|92|I'm sure he would love it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_304.wav|80|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_157.wav|87|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_133.wav|14|The answer was in space.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_151.wav|107|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_418.wav|7|My view has now completely changed.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_166.wav|12|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_370.wav|25|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_383.wav|98|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_202.wav|77|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_280.wav|24|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_298.wav|102|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_415.wav|37|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_188.wav|50|This is the time to use it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_133.wav|72|This is a wonderful honour for me.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_002.wav|105|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_321.wav|72|And then we got off the plane.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_125.wav|55|He is at peace with himself.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_274.wav|28|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_398.wav|6|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_415.wav|107|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_096.wav|8|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_079.wav|51|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_229.wav|73|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_227.wav|42|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_167.wav|5|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_242.wav|81|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_211.wav|9|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_071.wav|88|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_211.wav|89|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_358.wav|45|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_112.wav|9|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_076.wav|18|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_165.wav|9|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_295.wav|73|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_088.wav|13|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_081.wav|3|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_314.wav|103|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_209.wav|70|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_096.wav|75|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_205.wav|102|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_080.wav|24|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_179.wav|19|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_297.wav|61|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_332.wav|17|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_183.wav|82|They had seven children.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_051.wav|18|It means it is difficult.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_019.wav|0|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_214.wav|35|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_022.wav|26|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_372.wav|9|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_229.wav|106|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_202.wav|17|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_061.wav|100|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_122.wav|22|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_246.wav|50|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_115.wav|3|She is not a victim.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_357.wav|54|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_012.wav|87|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_057.wav|80|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_273.wav|22|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_248.wav|62|I was proud of our lads.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_065.wav|53|Indeed he has a lot of output.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_415.wav|89|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_175.wav|62|They want this research to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_200.wav|64|Now it has been eclipsed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_173.wav|79|Can he do it?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_200.wav|83|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_327.wav|82|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_243.wav|106|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_023.wav|106|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_080.wav|20|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_110.wav|70|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_056.wav|89|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_256.wav|51|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_353.wav|74|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_167.wav|99|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_471.wav|65|Each year they cut them down a bit.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_180.wav|27|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_308.wav|13|But let's not get carried away.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_244.wav|101|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_114.wav|36|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_342.wav|94|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_386.wav|103|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_226.wav|46|Our job is to change that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_146.wav|20|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_062.wav|19|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_336.wav|93|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_293.wav|58|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_079.wav|24|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_202.wav|104|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_022.wav|81|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_023.wav|68|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_070.wav|83|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_032.wav|57|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_327.wav|28|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_148.wav|47|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_066.wav|76|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_303.wav|99|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_147.wav|30|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_411.wav|27|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_299.wav|73|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_088.wav|85|I feel confident about the outcome.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_124.wav|96|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_105.wav|78|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_166.wav|54|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_139.wav|6|Changes need to be made.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_347.wav|27|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_402.wav|85|It was a great team effort.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_382.wav|63|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_138.wav|102|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_254.wav|68|I learned a lot from her.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_179.wav|98|We've got a mixture of both.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_404.wav|13|What is the Barnett formula?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_176.wav|69|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_154.wav|105|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_319.wav|0|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_066.wav|71|"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_388.wav|22|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_357.wav|100|Her life is now back on track.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_320.wav|44|I am proud of those guys.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_416.wav|79|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_458.wav|37|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_392.wav|39|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_122.wav|0|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_357.wav|42|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_217.wav|13|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_265.wav|11|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_156.wav|2|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_022.wav|51|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_234.wav|102|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_028.wav|79|These decisions are not simple.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_181.wav|56|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_126.wav|13|We are under no illusions about this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_406.wav|64|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_221.wav|27|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_115.wav|28|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_112.wav|67|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_030.wav|6|His party never arrived.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_150.wav|105|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_279.wav|58|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_106.wav|106|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_248.wav|46|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_282.wav|15|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_392.wav|60|It is a natural reaction.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_328.wav|28|We are the weakest link.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_097.wav|105|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_336.wav|58|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_272.wav|24|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_353.wav|35|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_099.wav|45|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_106.wav|37|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_258.wav|81|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_270.wav|102|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_094.wav|96|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_193.wav|91|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_109.wav|100|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_450.wav|32|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_032.wav|86|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_159.wav|1|I'm really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_119.wav|11|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_255.wav|90|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_379.wav|52|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_127.wav|94|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_137.wav|13|I still think he will win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_107.wav|85|It will have to ratify the deal.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_333.wav|91|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_379.wav|6|But is he?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_355.wav|26|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_081.wav|64|They wanted to show what they could do.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_302.wav|32|So the Government will be damaged.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_317.wav|83|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_023.wav|18|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_238.wav|56|We were well worth the win.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_164.wav|86|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_244.wav|39|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_247.wav|39|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_025.wav|73|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_179.wav|80|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p312/p312_341.wav|62|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_208.wav|98|So, where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_208.wav|29|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_004.wav|34|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_171.wav|77|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_324.wav|2|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_065.wav|13|It's really good, as long as we play well.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_254.wav|0|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_062.wav|94|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_039.wav|38|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_089.wav|25|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_131.wav|38|It was just an accident of birth.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_054.wav|2|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_125.wav|79|And if they fail?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_064.wav|7|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_068.wav|71|"It should be devolved."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_156.wav|35|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_002.wav|30|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_080.wav|79|But who is it?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_019.wav|6|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_085.wav|55|LET there be light.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_212.wav|74|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_138.wav|99|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_201.wav|63|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_282.wav|42|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_299.wav|3|We were well worth the win.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_009.wav|43|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_169.wav|4|O, Is there a lot of blood?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_321.wav|10|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_265.wav|38|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_330.wav|105|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_006.wav|11|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_191.wav|65|We tried four banks.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_419.wav|97|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_036.wav|66|That was no surprise to me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_070.wav|107|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_034.wav|79|I am really ready for it now.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_363.wav|105|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_178.wav|22|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_276.wav|84|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_294.wav|5|It was good.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_145.wav|90|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_190.wav|30|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_412.wav|54|Such people do not exist.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_326.wav|78|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_195.wav|50|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_156.wav|80|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_328.wav|98|And it's difficult to argue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_424.wav|65|Our performance wasn't perfect.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_182.wav|38|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_282.wav|1|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_336.wav|15|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_278.wav|74|We have worked well with them for years.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_149.wav|102|I feel my life to be at risk.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_066.wav|56|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_263.wav|78|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_114.wav|18|We're not that bad.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_298.wav|60|He did it well.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_024.wav|16|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_261.wav|42|She was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_176.wav|47|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_303.wav|4|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_126.wav|83|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_445.wav|106|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_147.wav|8|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_349.wav|43|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_045.wav|29|He was a home referee.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_382.wav|15|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_362.wav|21|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_168.wav|90|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_400.wav|62|Do what you have to do.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_379.wav|10|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_075.wav|13|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_380.wav|56|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_014.wav|51|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_111.wav|4|There could be no dispute about our history.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_155.wav|63|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_239.wav|103|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_162.wav|53|That will reduce my chance of selection.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_239.wav|57|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_291.wav|3|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_096.wav|30|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_445.wav|7|Such an attack is bizarre.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_330.wav|84|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_108.wav|94|It was quite rigorous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_105.wav|47|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_047.wav|52|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_293.wav|20|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_371.wav|55|He said legal action could be considered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_302.wav|34|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_040.wav|17|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_137.wav|31|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_079.wav|29|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_196.wav|66|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_340.wav|43|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_269.wav|76|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_044.wav|48|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_327.wav|22|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_332.wav|67|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_258.wav|74|Thankfully it was cleared up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_147.wav|100|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_169.wav|70|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_208.wav|81|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_135.wav|78|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_326.wav|66|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_291.wav|47|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_237.wav|99|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_086.wav|59|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_016.wav|1|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_055.wav|51|It was developed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_197.wav|72|But who knows?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_014.wav|13|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_136.wav|12|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_216.wav|74|Everything happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_200.wav|90|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_071.wav|81|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_119.wav|95|It's been a long wait.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_201.wav|17|That was the personal impulse.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_225.wav|66|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_153.wav|65|Their moment had come, or so they said.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_220.wav|83|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_162.wav|83|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_148.wav|74|They are working very well.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_160.wav|26|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_281.wav|22|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_381.wav|103|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_356.wav|12|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_020.wav|93|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_041.wav|19|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_051.wav|66|We are going for it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_235.wav|102|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_154.wav|53|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_139.wav|19|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_255.wav|21|However, my position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_332.wav|21|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_223.wav|61|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_201.wav|69|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_099.wav|21|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_214.wav|32|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_099.wav|1|There's nothing for the kids.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_266.wav|34|I was not happy about being left out.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_378.wav|93|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_356.wav|9|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_135.wav|104|It seemed to have direction.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_150.wav|44|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_290.wav|81|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_337.wav|38|With actors it is slightly different.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_199.wav|4|She was not hard done by.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_002.wav|90|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_249.wav|35|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_233.wav|4|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_301.wav|12|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_102.wav|26|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_124.wav|98|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_205.wav|10|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_146.wav|9|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_167.wav|92|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_170.wav|76|There is a simmering anger out there.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_096.wav|89|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_307.wav|37|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_366.wav|106|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_061.wav|60|I can't believe she is dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_006.wav|50|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_059.wav|98|They enjoy playing the game.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_230.wav|96|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_150.wav|90|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_286.wav|41|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_124.wav|5|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_164.wav|23|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_150.wav|32|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_186.wav|23|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_201.wav|32|That might mean another delay.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_140.wav|31|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_073.wav|37|And then there's the racial hassle.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_160.wav|32|The strong performance is expected to continue.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_376.wav|23|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_347.wav|60|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_113.wav|103|It has been hijacked.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_184.wav|99|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_378.wav|107|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_242.wav|35|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_171.wav|104|We have a genuine budget in place.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_188.wav|22|I hope you miss the cut.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_046.wav|4|My heart is with the artist.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_381.wav|1|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_311.wav|97|He was lying face down in the water.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_312.wav|5|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_115.wav|95|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_269.wav|42|The criteria have changed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_333.wav|27|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_049.wav|63|We are certainly talking about many millions.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_285.wav|82|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_356.wav|22|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_333.wav|74|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_009.wav|58|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_423.wav|11|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_332.wav|13|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_320.wav|101|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_155.wav|81|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_305.wav|79|We are right at the heart of Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_250.wav|106|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_238.wav|5|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_268.wav|74|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_226.wav|21|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_231.wav|47|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_203.wav|3|We can take the city.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_307.wav|32|They have shown a great desire and attitude.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_139.wav|22|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_355.wav|69|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_386.wav|78|An announcement is expected this week.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_004.wav|87|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_232.wav|3|It is the strength of the school.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_064.wav|79|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_184.wav|105|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_406.wav|47|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_023.wav|0|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_229.wav|94|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_300.wav|2|It could work.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_185.wav|53|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_355.wav|40|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_017.wav|20|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_072.wav|107|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_066.wav|13|We would certainly consider the proposals.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_346.wav|101|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_185.wav|62|He will continue to provide support for them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_379.wav|8|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_079.wav|41|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_400.wav|56|The results will take second place.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_318.wav|20|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_042.wav|0|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_359.wav|24|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_031.wav|53|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_110.wav|53|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_172.wav|51|This is good news for the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_072.wav|61|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_041.wav|37|She became a heroine of my childhood.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_023.wav|40|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_275.wav|20|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_225.wav|19|This was not an easy meeting for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_040.wav|76|They hit me in the head.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_319.wav|23|Frankly, they have to crack down.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_032.wav|70|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_211.wav|81|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_183.wav|75|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_323.wav|61|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_251.wav|6|I don't feel like working.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_074.wav|60|That took two weeks.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_283.wav|82|The only problem was, they were on himself.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_275.wav|17|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_163.wav|72|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_108.wav|16|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_103.wav|68|He went to see what he could learn.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_200.wav|63|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_063.wav|38|Tomorrow night is the important game.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_017.wav|26|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_312.wav|84|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_063.wav|68|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_364.wav|54|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_261.wav|2|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_114.wav|0|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_190.wav|14|The Royal Highland was no exception.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_179.wav|27|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_047.wav|61|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_374.wav|77|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_063.wav|95|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p339/p339_302.wav|18|That is exactly right.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_363.wav|43|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_278.wav|99|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_368.wav|86|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_030.wav|59|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_182.wav|32|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_024.wav|98|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_170.wav|36|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_055.wav|106|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_166.wav|37|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_196.wav|88|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_318.wav|16|The show is at an end.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_158.wav|37|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_294.wav|20|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_237.wav|52|He has worked for several years in the United States.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_367.wav|7|Nobody said it was required.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_069.wav|26|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_365.wav|70|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_098.wav|45|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_226.wav|51|That is not an easy thing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_129.wav|70|It's not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_121.wav|16|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_314.wav|43|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_241.wav|93|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_015.wav|27|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_064.wav|87|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_168.wav|11|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_444.wav|75|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_195.wav|22|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_066.wav|9|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_119.wav|99|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_379.wav|41|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_290.wav|76|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_111.wav|52|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_366.wav|32|Do not forget about Monaco.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_179.wav|54|He urged people to forgive.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_133.wav|3|He had no money left to run the club.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_398.wav|20|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_009.wav|20|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_124.wav|78|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_059.wav|77|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_220.wav|42|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_060.wav|38|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_416.wav|89|The people around me were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_035.wav|8|Costs have got to be controlled.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_325.wav|77|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_193.wav|88|I would say the risk is very small.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_193.wav|49|I am delighted with today's win.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_161.wav|4|They never got into the show this time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_393.wav|8|Glasgow University declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_054.wav|99|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_006.wav|68|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_126.wav|22|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_119.wav|52|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_142.wav|52|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_359.wav|60|He has never let them down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_132.wav|19|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_300.wav|94|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_325.wav|78|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_240.wav|3|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_169.wav|50|It is really good news.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_232.wav|92|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_354.wav|46|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_089.wav|68|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_399.wav|13|It is surprising to come back this way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_415.wav|33|His first album was a hit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_258.wav|92|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_331.wav|47|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_054.wav|80|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_373.wav|69|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_153.wav|7|That group reported just before Christmas.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_203.wav|106|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_385.wav|49|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_025.wav|2|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_343.wav|91|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_199.wav|85|However, he was later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_308.wav|0|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_277.wav|50|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_256.wav|63|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_352.wav|66|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_287.wav|74|And that is very good indeed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_011.wav|79|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_416.wav|8|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_161.wav|105|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_019.wav|18|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_030.wav|0|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_076.wav|58|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_201.wav|77|Getting this right is essential.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_368.wav|2|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_028.wav|41|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_202.wav|8|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_416.wav|74|I was frustrated here.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_193.wav|65|Do they think anyone else wants them?)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_369.wav|100|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_096.wav|62|The test case is still awaiting action.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_368.wav|4|I just did not cope with the pressure.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_198.wav|64|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_201.wav|7|It caused a lot of upset.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_170.wav|25|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_198.wav|13|You saw the pain he was in.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_240.wav|0|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_042.wav|12|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_064.wav|20|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_156.wav|46|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_096.wav|77|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_230.wav|27|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_013.wav|58|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_140.wav|82|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_007.wav|87|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_351.wav|95|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_095.wav|27|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_210.wav|14|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_132.wav|55|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_308.wav|9|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_309.wav|36|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_219.wav|58|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_236.wav|15|You mean he didn't get the girl?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_076.wav|78|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_313.wav|105|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_033.wav|97|But don't expect an easy ride.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_174.wav|41|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_052.wav|5|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_078.wav|7|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_188.wav|80|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_172.wav|78|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_187.wav|86|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_308.wav|50|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_022.wav|25|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_041.wav|67|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_231.wav|50|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_356.wav|13|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_037.wav|105|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_049.wav|68|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_067.wav|51|Let's see that increase over the years.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_073.wav|65|Confidence is as low as it can get.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_040.wav|78|She was at the top.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_246.wav|49|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_126.wav|37|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_145.wav|10|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_229.wav|70|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_360.wav|47|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_248.wav|76|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_061.wav|89|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_285.wav|10|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_045.wav|62|I certainly hope not.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_300.wav|103|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_327.wav|99|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_076.wav|0|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_218.wav|102|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_204.wav|51|Drugs are getting through.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_362.wav|50|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_342.wav|67|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_248.wav|69|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_093.wav|35|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_234.wav|33|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_100.wav|65|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_349.wav|56|He can handle it without any problem.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_078.wav|77|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_342.wav|96|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_187.wav|12|All were paid by the taxpayer.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_263.wav|81|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_328.wav|15|It will be a new experience.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_360.wav|48|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_248.wav|35|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_180.wav|69|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_024.wav|93|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_123.wav|97|It is essential that we win the game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_297.wav|74|I think they have got it completely right.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_015.wav|12|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_085.wav|96|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_075.wav|21|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_136.wav|61|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_017.wav|45|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_074.wav|92|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_310.wav|14|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_290.wav|17|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_388.wav|20|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_287.wav|35|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_329.wav|74|They worked on it for three hours.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_116.wav|38|If you're going to do it, do it right.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_095.wav|23|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_404.wav|46|The members have clearly spoken.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_029.wav|36|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_329.wav|54|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_407.wav|32|Nobody will be forced to work.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_090.wav|64|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_401.wav|94|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_367.wav|70|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_071.wav|13|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_290.wav|25|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_279.wav|1|It is always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_288.wav|78|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_205.wav|81|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_184.wav|20|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_213.wav|96|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_049.wav|22|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_038.wav|76|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_377.wav|10|The major championships will always have a special place.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_223.wav|77|It will now take over the running of the estate.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_067.wav|97|Wagner was never like this.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_316.wav|93|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_263.wav|82|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_381.wav|34|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_282.wav|40|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_074.wav|29|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_025.wav|34|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_183.wav|0|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_394.wav|64|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_196.wav|106|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_305.wav|48|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_397.wav|58|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_194.wav|55|A child is not a product.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_388.wav|37|His successor was only appointed last month.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_183.wav|83|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_408.wav|106|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_267.wav|55|He did better then.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_275.wav|53|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_295.wav|40|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_131.wav|45|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_231.wav|31|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_250.wav|100|It is now the big brother.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_110.wav|66|It was love of Helen and the children.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_118.wav|99|But the fans deserve to know!
DUMMY2/p306/p306_346.wav|12|English is the language of pop music.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_103.wav|52|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_151.wav|87|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p275/p275_098.wav|40|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_048.wav|50|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_041.wav|106|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_192.wav|34|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_303.wav|30|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_136.wav|80|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_079.wav|8|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_320.wav|75|Cast Away now on general release.

DUMMY2/p300/p300_329.wav|102|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_373.wav|47|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_189.wav|16|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_113.wav|91|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_299.wav|16|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_180.wav|38|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_107.wav|100|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_244.wav|107|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_075.wav|3|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_197.wav|40|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_191.wav|27|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_040.wav|57|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_341.wav|68|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_053.wav|83|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_051.wav|34|What's it for?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_017.wav|103|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_396.wav|97|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_133.wav|67|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_338.wav|27|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_279.wav|34|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_158.wav|104|The Treasury denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_040.wav|65|I am secure in my owns position.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_308.wav|87|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_339.wav|24|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_338.wav|22|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_362.wav|60|It's something he has worked very hard on.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_040.wav|15|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_192.wav|54|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_136.wav|98|It's very hard to plan for it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_055.wav|48|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_320.wav|46|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_419.wav|48|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_258.wav|107|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_013.wav|63|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_334.wav|0|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_075.wav|99|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_357.wav|45|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_331.wav|104|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_044.wav|62|This is not a monument to the past.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_004.wav|105|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_487.wav|75|We have to go for a win.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_063.wav|99|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_322.wav|35|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_271.wav|97|We have all been shocked by her death.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_078.wav|87|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_134.wav|68|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_290.wav|98|Fame and money followed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_168.wav|48|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_249.wav|98|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_351.wav|25|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_265.wav|4|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_161.wav|41|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_028.wav|1|Surely history will not repeat itself.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_100.wav|106|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_318.wav|36|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_018.wav|34|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_035.wav|34|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_193.wav|29|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_008.wav|77|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_333.wav|89|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_329.wav|64|I am not changing my event.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_313.wav|5|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_175.wav|76|It was that kind of night.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_192.wav|95|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_346.wav|78|The banking sector was weak.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_330.wav|82|WHO would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_147.wav|68|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_319.wav|28|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_057.wav|23|This is far too high.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_152.wav|75|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_251.wav|52|However, the figures tell a different story.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_347.wav|54|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_129.wav|2|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_215.wav|92|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_258.wav|27|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_423.wav|51|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_063.wav|24|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_222.wav|41|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_272.wav|20|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_028.wav|33|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_108.wav|71|"Maybe this battle has been."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_101.wav|62|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_186.wav|84|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_320.wav|7|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_034.wav|36|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_118.wav|53|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_301.wav|89|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_311.wav|44|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_262.wav|105|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_390.wav|13|This was not helpful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_120.wav|98|It's almost certainly not going to help.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_164.wav|89|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_202.wav|102|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_319.wav|93|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_048.wav|51|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_244.wav|81|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_292.wav|102|Everyone knew where they were.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_046.wav|57|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_019.wav|72|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_041.wav|17|Buying our way out is not an option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_414.wav|7|It is the nature of his party.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_054.wav|60|That will be important.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_010.wav|82|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_363.wav|15|They went down together.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_294.wav|50|Once again, they would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_007.wav|101|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_255.wav|20|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_308.wav|22|They will have to make changes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_183.wav|23|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_472.wav|48|We need a visionary producer.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_175.wav|102|You cannot eat in the dining room.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_010.wav|67|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_087.wav|103|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_047.wav|75|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_170.wav|35|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_141.wav|42|It is easy to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_353.wav|20|She is free.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_256.wav|3|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_188.wav|74|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_408.wav|65|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_260.wav|88|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_249.wav|44|We can just get on with our game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_243.wav|74|We just did not want to believe it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_249.wav|16|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_101.wav|35|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_021.wav|53|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_230.wav|44|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_160.wav|37|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_226.wav|104|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_187.wav|80|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_362.wav|16|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_167.wav|48|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_119.wav|7|We have the mental strength.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_365.wav|79|I don't think so.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_111.wav|9|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_378.wav|60|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_100.wav|42|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_251.wav|14|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_037.wav|34|They discussed how he might get involved.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_363.wav|77|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_076.wav|83|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_163.wav|51|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_064.wav|58|How could anyone take issue with that?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_404.wav|49|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_279.wav|20|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_114.wav|86|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_335.wav|51|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_271.wav|48|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_273.wav|28|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_090.wav|67|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_188.wav|9|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_044.wav|20|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_204.wav|43|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_018.wav|10|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_037.wav|29|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_367.wav|29|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_031.wav|65|I feel I did not have enough time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_350.wav|56|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_194.wav|42|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_031.wav|3|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_449.wav|100|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_213.wav|38|The house was full of smoke.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_345.wav|36|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_098.wav|60|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_154.wav|42|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_048.wav|96|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_179.wav|42|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_348.wav|52|And that is the bottom line - box office.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_082.wav|63|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_089.wav|98|But who was driving it?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_323.wav|9|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_270.wav|3|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_273.wav|34|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_114.wav|72|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_148.wav|27|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_355.wav|79|That would be unsafe.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_084.wav|3|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_254.wav|45|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_340.wav|15|O no it's not!
DUMMY2/p361/p361_404.wav|79|The message was clear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_401.wav|7|She said they would appeal.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_420.wav|8|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_170.wav|90|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_239.wav|61|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_344.wav|15|He was their leader.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_377.wav|107|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_279.wav|51|It could be a danger.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_218.wav|91|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_288.wav|21|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_272.wav|35|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_322.wav|40|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_131.wav|60|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_372.wav|31|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_365.wav|104|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_417.wav|89|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_066.wav|91|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_136.wav|26|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_130.wav|59|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_323.wav|94|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_023.wav|54|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_230.wav|78|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_039.wav|54|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_393.wav|79|But we are not afraid of them.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_075.wav|10|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_294.wav|103|The referee had been right.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_055.wav|69|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_236.wav|3|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_347.wav|2|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_254.wav|107|We are at a crossroads.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_386.wav|72|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_330.wav|63|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_142.wav|20|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_051.wav|26|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_170.wav|1|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_229.wav|18|I have always believed in myself.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_135.wav|18|That question was never asked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_413.wav|92|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_352.wav|5|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_411.wav|91|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_429.wav|32|I never had a childhood.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_329.wav|76|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_010.wav|47|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_072.wav|79|The problem is not confined to the UK.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_120.wav|106|Choice is a good thing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_402.wav|34|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_128.wav|40|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_025.wav|98|I am very happy with the result.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_100.wav|71|"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_261.wav|41|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_161.wav|52|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_244.wav|17|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_357.wav|19|It seems very odd.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_226.wav|38|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_200.wav|97|How do you respond to losing your child?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_415.wav|13|It is my decision and my decision alone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_315.wav|13|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_052.wav|74|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_263.wav|94|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_172.wav|22|The answer is mayhem.

DUMMY2/p295/p295_400.wav|92|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_328.wav|99|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.

DUMMY2/p251/p251_012.wav|9|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_270.wav|107|The outstanding issues are still there.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_255.wav|43|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_278.wav|52|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_070.wav|4|It happens in many countries.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_339.wav|12|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_216.wav|27|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_246.wav|85|It will be fine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_014.wav|27|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_242.wav|72|She said she would not welcome the flowers.

DUMMY2/p313/p313_015.wav|76|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_207.wav|15|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_043.wav|25|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_114.wav|21|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_243.wav|49|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_351.wav|59|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_370.wav|99|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_300.wav|22|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_068.wav|90|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_231.wav|3|He is a good friend.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_295.wav|58|I am not a free trader.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_387.wav|92|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_298.wav|27|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_295.wav|82|You have to count on other people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_095.wav|19|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_326.wav|28|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_275.wav|88|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_177.wav|88|It's very very frustrating.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_110.wav|57|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_184.wav|36|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_352.wav|92|Worse still, it can be infectious.

DUMMY2/p306/p306_001.wav|12|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_352.wav|65|That would concern me lot.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_078.wav|31|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_036.wav|10|Several investments have already been made.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_203.wav|40|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_336.wav|16|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_322.wav|31|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_318.wav|98|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_004.wav|54|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_298.wav|16|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_385.wav|0|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_076.wav|27|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_304.wav|14|He will address the nation this evening.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_034.wav|56|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_081.wav|51|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_058.wav|102|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_397.wav|64|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_073.wav|3|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_137.wav|105|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_310.wav|1|It is extremely popular with families.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_089.wav|45|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_411.wav|54|We believe the squad will stay together.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_129.wav|38|We are taking advice on this.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_169.wav|76|But what are the songs about?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_093.wav|33|Only he's not as young as he looks.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_108.wav|9|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_249.wav|48|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_174.wav|9|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_082.wav|11|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_366.wav|31|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_083.wav|90|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_439.wav|63|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_344.wav|83|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_209.wav|45|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_176.wav|88|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_109.wav|75|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_249.wav|51|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_171.wav|91|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_094.wav|12|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_257.wav|61|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_136.wav|46|I don't want to come down.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_185.wav|38|And what was that like, as an experience?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_121.wav|58|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_184.wav|44|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_346.wav|38|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_391.wav|7|They have broken that promise.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_085.wav|106|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_213.wav|83|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_101.wav|47|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_433.wav|56|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_065.wav|34|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_185.wav|69|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_137.wav|72|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_152.wav|54|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_363.wav|72|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_016.wav|27|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_081.wav|37|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_007.wav|104|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_452.wav|14|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_217.wav|65|Now we have fresh hope.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_057.wav|66|So the process was refined.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_335.wav|1|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_370.wav|6|And there are others.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_031.wav|56|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_122.wav|60|When she went off it was quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_019.wav|76|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_047.wav|0|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_134.wav|71|"It was typical."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_164.wav|31|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_149.wav|100|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_152.wav|70|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_206.wav|71|"I had relied on him."
DUMMY2/p270/p270_295.wav|8|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_388.wav|45|They are good.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_238.wav|9|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_026.wav|53|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_137.wav|97|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_291.wav|95|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_302.wav|60|I would not descend to that level.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_021.wav|54|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_207.wav|64|We didn't know he was even out.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_208.wav|96|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_283.wav|93|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_229.wav|0|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_038.wav|75|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_294.wav|3|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_272.wav|59|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_002.wav|80|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_282.wav|92|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_223.wav|41|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_307.wav|17|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_358.wav|18|Thereafter they were again in control.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_245.wav|28|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_142.wav|104|Where are they?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_169.wav|31|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_080.wav|81|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_184.wav|0|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_242.wav|83|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_050.wav|27|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_043.wav|27|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_299.wav|53|He could understand both points of view.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_377.wav|64|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_254.wav|11|This is certainly not the case.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_055.wav|23|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_048.wav|93|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_021.wav|20|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_325.wav|6|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_350.wav|23|Famously, though, there was a catch.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_018.wav|52|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_295.wav|24|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_241.wav|105|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_269.wav|34|The same goes for Russia.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_328.wav|13|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_210.wav|97|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_127.wav|52|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_191.wav|61|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_255.wav|58|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_005.wav|18|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_004.wav|23|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_265.wav|56|He could see no other bidder.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_086.wav|65|Because I was a very physical person.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_135.wav|69|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_159.wav|98|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_029.wav|34|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_114.wav|93|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_366.wav|86|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_186.wav|31|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_336.wav|47|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_149.wav|47|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_395.wav|50|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_090.wav|21|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_389.wav|54|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_336.wav|80|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_244.wav|19|This was done by the council staff.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_086.wav|37|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_075.wav|42|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_008.wav|19|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_339.wav|4|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_215.wav|90|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_396.wav|15|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_210.wav|69|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_174.wav|64|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_417.wav|78|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_211.wav|19|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_168.wav|87|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_380.wav|65|I have been going through a lot of things.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_154.wav|93|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_041.wav|33|Will we ever play together again?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_108.wav|57|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_172.wav|5|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_321.wav|19|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_344.wav|33|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_277.wav|61|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_365.wav|41|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_189.wav|37|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_313.wav|102|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_213.wav|25|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_032.wav|52|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_299.wav|82|I was a local hero.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_067.wav|12|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_340.wav|98|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_415.wav|100|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_236.wav|95|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_338.wav|15|There are a number of possible outcomes.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_380.wav|38|I don't have a problem with getting older.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_371.wav|68|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_435.wav|8|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_317.wav|23|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_420.wav|24|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_296.wav|56|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_011.wav|61|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_284.wav|84|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_238.wav|69|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_085.wav|49|He was extremely nervous.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_111.wav|42|What was it like playing real people?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_193.wav|105|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_393.wav|1|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_329.wav|41|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_392.wav|97|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_245.wav|85|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_058.wav|19|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_179.wav|104|He could tell you.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_369.wav|21|The warning was lifted late last night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_022.wav|99|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_217.wav|1|Are there muscular problems?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_244.wav|86|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_441.wav|24|There were a lot of emotions.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_165.wav|83|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_188.wav|99|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_334.wav|79|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_267.wav|25|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_207.wav|57|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_415.wav|38|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_065.wav|45|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_398.wav|13|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_145.wav|78|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_308.wav|35|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_272.wav|41|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_055.wav|20|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_404.wav|55|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_168.wav|45|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_173.wav|26|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_179.wav|56|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_287.wav|40|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_180.wav|81|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_169.wav|104|I enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_288.wav|97|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_334.wav|53|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_285.wav|56|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_296.wav|37|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_244.wav|91|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_377.wav|74|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_120.wav|26|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_283.wav|44|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_281.wav|4|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_084.wav|98|It will be easier for us.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_162.wav|90|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_272.wav|93|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_035.wav|11|We are expecting a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_195.wav|107|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_392.wav|54|The love affair was over.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_078.wav|6|We did not deserve to go through.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_345.wav|76|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_239.wav|7|They are difficult awards to decide.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_124.wav|39|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_381.wav|97|There will be two other areas of contention.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_174.wav|97|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_247.wav|18|Did it work?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_037.wav|88|It isn't a free-for-all.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_309.wav|5|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_313.wav|28|They should use it on the catwalk.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_293.wav|78|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_081.wav|85|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_107.wav|54|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_312.wav|81|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_241.wav|42|Every game against New Zealand is.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_141.wav|44|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_299.wav|34|We were a little bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_330.wav|15|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_217.wav|28|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_043.wav|86|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_256.wav|0|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_140.wav|69|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_191.wav|47|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_367.wav|51|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_293.wav|106|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_021.wav|41|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_267.wav|46|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_407.wav|54|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_259.wav|72|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_423.wav|64|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_433.wav|8|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_082.wav|93|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_373.wav|1|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_146.wav|103|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_201.wav|59|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_315.wav|29|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_348.wav|35|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_339.wav|14|The election is total confusion and chaos.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_061.wav|67|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_419.wav|103|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_369.wav|77|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_310.wav|48|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_372.wav|14|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_326.wav|2|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_029.wav|54|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_050.wav|25|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_247.wav|24|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_146.wav|46|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_322.wav|58|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_084.wav|54|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_367.wav|34|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_075.wav|77|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_088.wav|45|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_078.wav|95|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_173.wav|88|England will be under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_386.wav|40|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_061.wav|61|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_403.wav|47|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_378.wav|39|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_375.wav|63|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_294.wav|71|"He has retired."
DUMMY2/p363/p363_257.wav|6|We would like to see them in court.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_201.wav|3|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_329.wav|2|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_056.wav|50|Italy is a beautiful place.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_376.wav|41|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_344.wav|31|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_016.wav|36|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_014.wav|52|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_040.wav|2|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_094.wav|51|They are completely different from each other.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_251.wav|21|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_311.wav|61|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_220.wav|24|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_280.wav|81|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_105.wav|8|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_168.wav|4|The criteria have changed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_375.wav|35|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_150.wav|94|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_251.wav|41|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_119.wav|66|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_178.wav|11|There's no reason for panic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_126.wav|93|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_339.wav|106|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_405.wav|76|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_356.wav|59|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_427.wav|48|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_037.wav|38|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_233.wav|82|The game was up.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_257.wav|78|It was really good in the first week.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_155.wav|24|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_321.wav|47|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_112.wav|38|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_057.wav|61|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_177.wav|71|"It is the whole package."
DUMMY2/p239/p239_028.wav|48|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_348.wav|43|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_128.wav|45|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_267.wav|88|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_157.wav|107|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_412.wav|50|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_294.wav|18|But it will not work again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_183.wav|99|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_388.wav|58|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_277.wav|49|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_323.wav|93|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_416.wav|106|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_330.wav|6|He was a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_310.wav|37|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_357.wav|60|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_199.wav|6|Well, you might have a point.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_095.wav|15|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_015.wav|72|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_020.wav|77|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_165.wav|4|There was nothing else to match it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_110.wav|83|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_192.wav|88|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_384.wav|104|We had our chances.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_243.wav|34|The result could be all down to turnout.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_078.wav|65|That is very important.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_235.wav|25|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_364.wav|67|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_173.wav|52|If successful, several records will be made.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_252.wav|103|I have no comment to make.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_273.wav|101|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_101.wav|66|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_416.wav|48|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_009.wav|66|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_446.wav|95|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_041.wav|34|We know the quality of life goes up.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_016.wav|98|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_373.wav|74|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_230.wav|8|There's a chance they might come down.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_405.wav|74|He said no survivors had been found.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_301.wav|61|That could change.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_146.wav|62|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_079.wav|59|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_391.wav|82|There is ample evidence.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_080.wav|2|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_313.wav|54|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_380.wav|54|He was released in March this year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_037.wav|106|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_139.wav|41|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_314.wav|96|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_084.wav|62|There are many children.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_394.wav|97|The committees are due to report next year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_346.wav|28|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_266.wav|60|He was pleased with his display.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_079.wav|35|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_030.wav|90|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_141.wav|99|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_186.wav|44|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_070.wav|93|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_022.wav|24|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_318.wav|74|They have not changed at all.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_171.wav|54|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_339.wav|92|However, that could alter following the latest case.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_298.wav|22|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_178.wav|86|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_339.wav|85|It's a national sport.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_441.wav|50|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_267.wav|60|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_192.wav|62|I was a bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_313.wav|81|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_399.wav|94|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_298.wav|32|You have to expect this type of thing.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_373.wav|100|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_071.wav|5|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_247.wav|76|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_242.wav|92|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_071.wav|84|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_172.wav|91|The answer is mayhem.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_463.wav|63|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_384.wav|27|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_223.wav|80|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_134.wav|79|It's a matter for the Committee.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_150.wav|47|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_006.wav|33|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_224.wav|73|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_212.wav|60|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_228.wav|41|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_250.wav|66|I'll go back home and see my family.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_305.wav|69|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_121.wav|80|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_328.wav|96|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_043.wav|33|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_300.wav|86|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_064.wav|31|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_299.wav|79|Again, there was no detail.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_199.wav|9|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_287.wav|55|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_038.wav|46|We have nothing to say about that.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_266.wav|55|Look at a computer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_058.wav|14|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_094.wav|28|That'd be good for the whole city.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_232.wav|4|We have to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_025.wav|102|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_425.wav|95|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_239.wav|92|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_440.wav|50|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_356.wav|46|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_248.wav|42|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_330.wav|19|We are now in an election period.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_384.wav|17|And they all had these other commitments.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_243.wav|31|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_102.wav|30|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_113.wav|11|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_029.wav|44|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_167.wav|106|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_295.wav|106|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_178.wav|58|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_280.wav|67|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_315.wav|18|That is an entirely different discipline.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_093.wav|13|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_270.wav|19|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_201.wav|88|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_452.wav|24|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_311.wav|90|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_178.wav|26|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_027.wav|79|He may not need to force that message.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_289.wav|9|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_284.wav|65|It's not a small step.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_405.wav|96|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_207.wav|30|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_243.wav|18|I could have been killed on that day.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_098.wav|99|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_164.wav|72|And there is no cause for it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_363.wav|14|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_027.wav|54|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_362.wav|89|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_130.wav|16|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_079.wav|40|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_225.wav|104|Gas is too expensive.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_395.wav|1|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_133.wav|31|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_359.wav|16|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_386.wav|11|For tragedy it is.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_081.wav|106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_423.wav|78|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_143.wav|9|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_281.wav|11|We are delighted with that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_131.wav|27|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_241.wav|70|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_477.wav|14|The casting of her husband was an accident.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_419.wav|40|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_282.wav|30|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_027.wav|44|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_280.wav|44|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_442.wav|95|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_093.wav|38|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_234.wav|74|They didn't find any substance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_071.wav|33|It's really good, as long as we play well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_370.wav|106|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_269.wav|70|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_271.wav|67|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_368.wav|87|Weather should not be a factor.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_167.wav|13|It was the first time they met.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_305.wav|83|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_435.wav|95|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_193.wav|56|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_174.wav|17|He put a lot of effort into it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_117.wav|63|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_071.wav|82|I had to lie.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_168.wav|65|Everything people said about it was true.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_137.wav|59|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_032.wav|83|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_357.wav|78|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_406.wav|34|A decision about that will be made today.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_413.wav|85|I have never been overly ambitious.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_042.wav|55|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_046.wav|90|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_487.wav|24|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_237.wav|22|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_310.wav|11|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_299.wav|70|It could work.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_200.wav|17|They responded with victories.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_251.wav|8|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_013.wav|10|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_356.wav|103|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_302.wav|4|My position on the euro is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_171.wav|65|It is a large number.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_244.wav|74|The medal itself is not that important.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_207.wav|66|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_213.wav|74|It was properly reported to us.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_296.wav|91|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_080.wav|37|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_043.wav|50|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_162.wav|34|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_154.wav|51|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_038.wav|19|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_133.wav|57|This plan is an agenda for action.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_210.wav|89|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_315.wav|43|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_281.wav|94|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_390.wav|24|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_022.wav|31|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_304.wav|15|He added, We are full of anger.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_284.wav|79|We have been here before.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_160.wav|27|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_089.wav|79|We all want to be left alone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_224.wav|101|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_314.wav|18|They were following his orders.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_162.wav|36|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_130.wav|82|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_283.wav|52|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_142.wav|51|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_205.wav|86|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_363.wav|62|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_111.wav|25|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_352.wav|53|Sales will begin by the end of October.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_259.wav|106|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_081.wav|2|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_078.wav|70|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_254.wav|96|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_208.wav|11|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_122.wav|68|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_281.wav|37|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_249.wav|38|That's why they go to the opera.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_158.wav|58|But we are severely limited in funds.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_346.wav|84|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_276.wav|36|We feel very good about it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_328.wav|48|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_284.wav|57|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_230.wav|67|Who was on the panel ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_414.wav|35|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_064.wav|53|It also has a good labour supply.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_347.wav|38|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_147.wav|86|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_116.wav|94|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_146.wav|96|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_323.wav|84|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_416.wav|105|Rather than answer, she resigned.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_149.wav|74|And he listens to his artists as well.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_193.wav|23|This is simply unjust.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_448.wav|65|Powers looks straight ahead.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_242.wav|19|I tried to push him away.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_327.wav|89|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_240.wav|4|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_309.wav|99|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_078.wav|62|However, there would be no permanent displays.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_043.wav|82|However, there were some alarming findings.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_015.wav|93|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_410.wav|56|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_259.wav|91|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_365.wav|67|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_075.wav|49|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_227.wav|76|That figure will always remain with me.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_342.wav|2|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_173.wav|33|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_067.wav|29|I have proved that in the past.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_067.wav|73|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_385.wav|46|They didn't find anything.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_081.wav|29|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_026.wav|81|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_021.wav|31|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_112.wav|35|We have the mental strength.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_210.wav|0|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_095.wav|8|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_248.wav|43|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_135.wav|20|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_144.wav|1|Was society doing enough?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_112.wav|49|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_364.wav|107|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_177.wav|77|People like to talk about these things.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_220.wav|53|I was independent but I am not now.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_166.wav|38|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_340.wav|66|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_053.wav|6|So now we know.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_024.wav|69|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_124.wav|61|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_155.wav|58|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_387.wav|13|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_067.wav|98|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_135.wav|48|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_017.wav|76|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_140.wav|47|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_257.wav|69|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_399.wav|77|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_019.wav|99|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_289.wav|43|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_214.wav|46|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_244.wav|5|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_242.wav|96|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_089.wav|70|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_271.wav|15|This is not a crisis.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_464.wav|24|The damage is all inside.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_009.wav|47|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_060.wav|0|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_022.wav|63|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_063.wav|30|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_082.wav|51|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_271.wav|36|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_356.wav|6|This place is outstanding.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_330.wav|49|The whole thing would be perfect.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_224.wav|24|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_270.wav|40|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_177.wav|44|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_177.wav|31|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_328.wav|92|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_169.wav|55|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_281.wav|56|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_233.wav|95|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_056.wav|99|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_034.wav|32|Several investments have already been made.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_098.wav|20|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_223.wav|68|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_139.wav|93|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_402.wav|24|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_128.wav|66|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_041.wav|91|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_086.wav|68|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_137.wav|75|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_061.wav|98|It is not standing army.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_255.wav|60|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_343.wav|13|And right now, it isn't there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_315.wav|42|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_361.wav|62|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_212.wav|101|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_171.wav|73|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_114.wav|40|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_214.wav|17|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_147.wav|5|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_389.wav|4|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_094.wav|38|Libya is an easy target.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_300.wav|79|Let the voters decide.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_234.wav|60|So what's it all about?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_187.wav|16|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_083.wav|103|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_296.wav|53|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_112.wav|64|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_064.wav|39|I am pleased to be in them.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_375.wav|60|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_138.wav|87|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_150.wav|40|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_139.wav|62|It's the same with us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_299.wav|42|It has not yet opened to pupils.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_068.wav|20|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_012.wav|44|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_141.wav|32|But she was very human.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_102.wav|88|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_203.wav|98|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_443.wav|39|No decisions have been made in this respect.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_004.wav|53|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_375.wav|38|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_171.wav|5|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_144.wav|40|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_204.wav|58|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_346.wav|6|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_030.wav|29|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_068.wav|17|This is about the Orange Order.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_246.wav|102|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_114.wav|95|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_092.wav|71|"They are now divorced."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_007.wav|82|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_126.wav|8|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_383.wav|100|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_073.wav|92|Where does he go from here?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_199.wav|88|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_059.wav|96|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_039.wav|6|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_313.wav|66|Calderwood would agree with that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_313.wav|37|Movie stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_191.wav|101|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_307.wav|50|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_113.wav|87|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_346.wav|22|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_193.wav|107|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_385.wav|77|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_285.wav|39|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_001.wav|102|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_180.wav|47|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_454.wav|95|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_139.wav|2|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_267.wav|15|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_216.wav|32|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_268.wav|53|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_196.wav|84|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_318.wav|75|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_329.wav|7|I was just so determined.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_190.wav|44|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_238.wav|28|I'm happy with the outcome.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_375.wav|99|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_355.wav|33|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_473.wav|24|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_356.wav|66|She had every right to read the warrant.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_385.wav|26|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_108.wav|31|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_354.wav|62|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_056.wav|75|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_357.wav|50|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_013.wav|105|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_312.wav|86|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_421.wav|76|It appears to have been closed down.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_252.wav|14|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_075.wav|64|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_194.wav|64|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_149.wav|54|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_263.wav|80|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_167.wav|72|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_173.wav|74|And did they have sex?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_128.wav|33|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_345.wav|103|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_253.wav|56|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_372.wav|86|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_115.wav|73|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_165.wav|103|That's the way it is.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_287.wav|60|We know the fight is going to happen.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_273.wav|66|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_219.wav|105|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_020.wav|5|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_005.wav|0|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_194.wav|38|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_226.wav|60|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_194.wav|16|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_216.wav|63|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_005.wav|81|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_398.wav|24|He has earned the right to their respect.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_210.wav|91|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_201.wav|66|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_007.wav|33|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_190.wav|49|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_186.wav|43|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_100.wav|15|There's a strong involvement.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_268.wav|31|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_151.wav|61|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_278.wav|95|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_253.wav|75|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_227.wav|56|It had so much to do with the output.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_089.wav|96|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_229.wav|50|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_458.wav|75|And it covers the spectrum.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_304.wav|89|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_082.wav|39|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_199.wav|90|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_289.wav|96|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_057.wav|91|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_122.wav|102|I will speak to Michael about this.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_363.wav|27|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_428.wav|105|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_273.wav|1|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_345.wav|102|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_232.wav|64|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_003.wav|62|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_016.wav|37|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_064.wav|60|Most of the works are small in scale.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_146.wav|40|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_028.wav|81|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_188.wav|54|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_071.wav|90|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_080.wav|93|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_433.wav|89|We were used.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_301.wav|16|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_182.wav|83|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_345.wav|60|How did it all come about?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_161.wav|88|It is not illegal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_013.wav|76|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_246.wav|63|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_361.wav|11|I hope that is the lucky break.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_262.wav|91|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_119.wav|10|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_258.wav|29|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_175.wav|58|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_235.wav|14|Truth is the child of time.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_063.wav|98|Someone else has now got them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_148.wav|76|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_152.wav|102|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_297.wav|89|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_180.wav|84|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_007.wav|14|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p256/p256_285.wav|90|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_144.wav|101|She will do for me.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_158.wav|28|It's not just a male agenda.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_038.wav|12|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_350.wav|27|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_256.wav|55|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_199.wav|97|That's how she wants to remember him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_041.wav|78|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_142.wav|48|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_339.wav|32|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_107.wav|51|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_115.wav|45|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_271.wav|10|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_406.wav|97|They will have to cut through the roof.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_185.wav|98|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_394.wav|47|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_157.wav|106|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_178.wav|27|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_312.wav|17|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_313.wav|90|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_225.wav|46|But Annika is just amazing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_240.wav|80|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_062.wav|89|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_154.wav|85|You look at that.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_237.wav|68|But one shouldn't go by that.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_126.wav|47|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_093.wav|42|I sincerely hope not.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_069.wav|1|This is a most serious matter.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_326.wav|22|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_101.wav|54|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_230.wav|83|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_366.wav|43|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_030.wav|7|I could not do it.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_021.wav|96|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_018.wav|36|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_018.wav|38|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_281.wav|104|I've never seen them down here.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_309.wav|101|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_321.wav|23|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_439.wav|106|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_025.wav|90|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_062.wav|104|Debate is not just talk.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_214.wav|100|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_317.wav|106|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_387.wav|20|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_295.wav|7|They must play for each other.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_202.wav|66|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_140.wav|62|It's an awful lot of money.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_244.wav|16|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_279.wav|8|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_009.wav|107|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_038.wav|1|It is my nature.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_016.wav|19|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_136.wav|84|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_409.wav|51|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_245.wav|21|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_127.wav|9|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_060.wav|47|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_276.wav|80|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_025.wav|43|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_217.wav|97|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_456.wav|63|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_038.wav|91|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_049.wav|75|This is the interesting part.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_277.wav|45|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_202.wav|16|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_322.wav|45|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_116.wav|6|But that is not enough.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_104.wav|68|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_094.wav|16|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_291.wav|55|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_227.wav|15|No wonder he missed the conversion.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_088.wav|82|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_145.wav|71|"It is like a football team."
DUMMY2/p280/p280_376.wav|52|It used to be all hard sell.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_274.wav|17|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_211.wav|39|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_339.wav|17|You need a reason for staying.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_251.wav|88|It was really surprising.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_049.wav|30|Happily we found it in the library.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_109.wav|55|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_138.wav|2|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_275.wav|84|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_109.wav|8|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_263.wav|46|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_045.wav|33|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_359.wav|39|There is a good example in this city.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_082.wav|73|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_093.wav|25|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_300.wav|13|The atmosphere was excellent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_041.wav|56|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_198.wav|87|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_176.wav|87|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_332.wav|38|Are you from the rugby?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_330.wav|52|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_424.wav|22|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_166.wav|41|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_161.wav|49|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_355.wav|35|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_221.wav|82|It's the right thing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_409.wav|92|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_020.wav|18|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_389.wav|84|What happened in the summer ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_324.wav|31|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_198.wav|22|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_002.wav|45|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_027.wav|71|"He said the matter had been neglected in the past."
DUMMY2/p302/p302_211.wav|30|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_366.wav|84|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_011.wav|54|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_006.wav|95|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_252.wav|59|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_063.wav|91|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_305.wav|20|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_204.wav|97|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_389.wav|1|If only we had known.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_110.wav|37|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_142.wav|24|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_166.wav|21|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_283.wav|98|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_205.wav|50|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_077.wav|43|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_281.wav|67|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_205.wav|76|So she told him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_301.wav|25|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_196.wav|35|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_035.wav|70|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_424.wav|77|Both promotions come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_312.wav|104|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_280.wav|39|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_367.wav|69|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_226.wav|36|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_041.wav|74|We didn't deserve to win.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_222.wav|81|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_003.wav|18|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_320.wav|15|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_176.wav|95|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_105.wav|76|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_391.wav|29|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_296.wav|28|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_133.wav|48|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_176.wav|101|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_147.wav|73|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_136.wav|57|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_267.wav|36|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_224.wav|19|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_129.wav|20|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_115.wav|12|There is no point in pushing it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_126.wav|50|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_004.wav|21|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_340.wav|9|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_138.wav|49|This is not presently the case.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_064.wav|59|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_163.wav|67|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_279.wav|10|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_224.wav|72|He was correct in everything he did.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_082.wav|44|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_024.wav|44|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_114.wav|67|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_019.wav|58|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_088.wav|93|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_028.wav|28|It is believed he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_291.wav|1|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_091.wav|4|Some things in life you have to accept.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_112.wav|107|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_270.wav|88|For many, it had become a fact of life.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_074.wav|61|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_087.wav|79|This is a personal decision for me.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_368.wav|17|But does the same thing happen with music?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_163.wav|12|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_315.wav|91|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_137.wav|37|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_103.wav|70|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_098.wav|5|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_046.wav|55|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_124.wav|2|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_331.wav|102|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_143.wav|102|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_264.wav|50|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_047.wav|106|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_279.wav|59|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_151.wav|21|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_015.wav|4|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_082.wav|24|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_374.wav|11|This is the goal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_365.wav|34|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_048.wav|71|"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_324.wav|82|But could it afford to run it?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_262.wav|1|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_153.wav|63|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_436.wav|89|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_046.wav|99|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_089.wav|65|The savings can be dramatic.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_273.wav|82|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_324.wav|84|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_137.wav|33|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_306.wav|68|Some have other commitments.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_392.wav|45|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_137.wav|39|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_310.wav|21|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_142.wav|39|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_231.wav|8|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_206.wav|41|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_077.wav|83|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_149.wav|36|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_323.wav|64|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_099.wav|49|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_033.wav|58|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_307.wav|78|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_146.wav|86|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_154.wav|81|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_224.wav|14|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_024.wav|51|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_278.wav|18|It does nothing for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_125.wav|76|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_080.wav|78|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_087.wav|96|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_355.wav|64|We have obviously got some work to do.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_286.wav|39|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_288.wav|59|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_234.wav|12|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_316.wav|96|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_253.wav|24|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_383.wav|70|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_267.wav|31|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_357.wav|85|Do you know who we are?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_267.wav|27|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_254.wav|60|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_206.wav|53|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_079.wav|32|It is the only company of its kind in the UK.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_063.wav|92|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_190.wav|16|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_357.wav|99|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_046.wav|22|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_364.wav|42|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_220.wav|52|I was independent but I am not now.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_174.wav|75|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_318.wav|56|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_051.wav|35|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_272.wav|82|This action could have been avoided.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_360.wav|16|She is free.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_454.wav|65|He was then replaced by Ross.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_074.wav|35|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_104.wav|6|It's somewhere in between.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_160.wav|48|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_060.wav|94|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_169.wav|60|It is about the script for me.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_203.wav|35|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_226.wav|89|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_118.wav|50|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_271.wav|52|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_352.wav|59|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_194.wav|41|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_072.wav|4|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_308.wav|38|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_268.wav|50|I've had the time of my life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_053.wav|40|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_125.wav|54|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_319.wav|21|It is not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_139.wav|42|It's not a great art.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_201.wav|10|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_079.wav|49|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_087.wav|55|Scotland has great assets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_025.wav|9|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_027.wav|74|We've just decided to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_098.wav|75|We created so many chances.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_153.wav|30|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_404.wav|105|It is simple, but profound.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_213.wav|75|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_375.wav|6|Just look at his record.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_171.wav|71|"Waiting times for these services are too long."
DUMMY2/p249/p249_302.wav|80|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_383.wav|97|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_357.wav|24|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_128.wav|57|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_377.wav|69|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_346.wav|24|He has made his base in Spain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_324.wav|78|However, the devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_107.wav|90|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_337.wav|95|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_148.wav|43|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_106.wav|58|That was the light relief.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_100.wav|27|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_238.wav|96|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_233.wav|38|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_246.wav|68|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_285.wav|94|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_368.wav|15|You can't really compare.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_177.wav|82|That will be the case.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_100.wav|24|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_008.wav|93|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_072.wav|23|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_316.wav|7|The record companies have gone through the floor.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_307.wav|67|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_121.wav|37|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_261.wav|38|He was sentenced to seven years.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_328.wav|68|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_098.wav|105|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_276.wav|34|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_313.wav|40|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_293.wav|76|This year, it was a little different.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_490.wav|65|We've got good options.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_278.wav|41|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_072.wav|70|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_075.wav|98|But we will learn from that.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_264.wav|58|So there's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_169.wav|48|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_087.wav|61|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_141.wav|38|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_363.wav|56|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_125.wav|80|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_223.wav|13|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_200.wav|1|This is a good result for them.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_008.wav|107|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_301.wav|7|This could put pressure on UK inflation.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_313.wav|8|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_086.wav|57|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_088.wav|71|"Then came the crunch."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_016.wav|33|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_131.wav|32|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_166.wav|94|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_341.wav|42|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_052.wav|41|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_213.wav|67|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_111.wav|77|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_319.wav|98|This is a problem we have to tackle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_271.wav|54|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_228.wav|23|These will be finally corrected by next week.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_387.wav|96|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_102.wav|11|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_256.wav|45|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_040.wav|85|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_308.wav|84|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_214.wav|83|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_218.wav|48|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_392.wav|37|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_273.wav|85|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_108.wav|48|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_122.wav|26|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_281.wav|103|I have beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_308.wav|95|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_055.wav|54|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_183.wav|9|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_357.wav|16|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_011.wav|77|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_128.wav|68|A lot of people were in tears.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_275.wav|80|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_008.wav|95|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_346.wav|2|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_100.wav|97|But don't worry just yet.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_003.wav|69|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_048.wav|42|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_235.wav|76|My body is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_293.wav|30|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_191.wav|5|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_105.wav|42|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_391.wav|58|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_443.wav|32|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_142.wav|85|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_244.wav|83|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_328.wav|80|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_125.wav|2|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_188.wav|36|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_061.wav|52|Talks have continued at many different levels.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_208.wav|74|We lost out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_081.wav|22|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_423.wav|24|Russell is delighted with them.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_478.wav|75|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_349.wav|17|He showed he has some things to learn.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_467.wav|100|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_123.wav|87|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_309.wav|59|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_187.wav|67|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_326.wav|92|It was hugely popular decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_345.wav|64|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_016.wav|88|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_380.wav|7|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_307.wav|18|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_285.wav|11|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_070.wav|56|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_184.wav|79|There was nothing she could do.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_126.wav|12|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_449.wav|89|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_052.wav|91|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_302.wav|1|Chris is big and jolly.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_164.wav|21|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_069.wav|88|It lasted longer than we thought.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_217.wav|87|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_352.wav|28|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_254.wav|81|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_290.wav|44|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_193.wav|64|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_032.wav|38|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_234.wav|10|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_105.wav|13|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_451.wav|50|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_293.wav|101|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_195.wav|15|I never had any real direction at school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_274.wav|10|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_003.wav|39|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_394.wav|1|They will now get that support.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_425.wav|8|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_349.wav|102|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_170.wav|21|Do they have to create seven majors?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_034.wav|86|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_090.wav|5|This one did.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_266.wav|103|I hope he stays.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_149.wav|44|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_172.wav|17|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_253.wav|10|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_360.wav|25|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_278.wav|88|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_353.wav|67|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_058.wav|33|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_239.wav|20|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_419.wav|79|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_168.wav|103|I am not a magician.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_138.wav|106|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_317.wav|16|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_258.wav|26|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_319.wav|51|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_180.wav|10|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_143.wav|18|Rangers must be winners, it says.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_270.wav|65|I knew him well.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_006.wav|82|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_229.wav|81|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_208.wav|68|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_005.wav|46|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_139.wav|23|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_287.wav|34|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_045.wav|98|That, though, was just the start of it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_049.wav|65|I only signed this morning.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_421.wav|24|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_193.wav|31|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_259.wav|82|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_121.wav|94|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_325.wav|58|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_200.wav|80|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_078.wav|67|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_141.wav|15|That is my dream.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_374.wav|22|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_220.wav|88|That suggests that out fitness is good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_083.wav|89|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_137.wav|56|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_140.wav|89|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_048.wav|31|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_182.wav|6|Now is the time for action.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_157.wav|53|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_296.wav|1|For now, we must take one game at a time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_149.wav|90|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_369.wav|96|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_013.wav|104|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_028.wav|50|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_093.wav|8|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p278/p278_113.wav|10|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_374.wav|2|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_054.wav|43|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_096.wav|22|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_217.wav|44|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_244.wav|50|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_182.wav|14|His team management was protective.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_042.wav|9|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_367.wav|53|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_203.wav|51|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_061.wav|81|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_344.wav|95|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_033.wav|74|We don't find any danger from them.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_087.wav|64|The Hague is too good for him.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_015.wav|47|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_384.wav|50|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_419.wav|51|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_341.wav|94|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_202.wav|93|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_374.wav|45|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_296.wav|61|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_274.wav|39|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_290.wav|82|It starts to get you down.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_149.wav|67|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_020.wav|49|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_084.wav|55|He has a real potential.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_294.wav|28|So what is it with Nato?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_215.wav|72|Pupils will be the losers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_236.wav|49|I don't have any answer for them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_365.wav|68|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_315.wav|4|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_299.wav|10|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_101.wav|75|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_108.wav|54|She is a double victim.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_345.wav|14|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_144.wav|77|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_266.wav|32|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_409.wav|91|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_075.wav|1|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_179.wav|52|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_011.wav|103|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_122.wav|80|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_046.wav|40|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_222.wav|11|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_048.wav|58|It's to do with play.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_021.wav|90|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_067.wav|82|Who would have known.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_337.wav|21|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_226.wav|91|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_267.wav|68|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_117.wav|50|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_402.wav|13|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_138.wav|41|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_190.wav|35|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_390.wav|33|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_059.wav|107|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_409.wav|106|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_119.wav|44|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_048.wav|6|He will never be forgotten.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_433.wav|24|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_146.wav|102|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_378.wav|58|He has never even been to Ireland.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_269.wav|23|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_050.wav|83|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_437.wav|48|Things are going to change over the next six months.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_056.wav|101|Clearly, it can go either way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_276.wav|33|We have been very patient.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_355.wav|45|A man has since been charged with his murder.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_252.wav|70|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_250.wav|88|We just need the Government to act.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_078.wav|85|Robin Williams is subdued.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_046.wav|66|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_118.wav|35|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_192.wav|60|But there was no going back.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_278.wav|64|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_310.wav|29|We are not increasing the number.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_367.wav|79|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_467.wav|48|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_093.wav|86|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_159.wav|58|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_231.wav|52|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_400.wav|55|We will miss him against Celtic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_363.wav|89|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_383.wav|48|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_039.wav|88|I was not fit enough and it showed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_303.wav|46|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_158.wav|86|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_199.wav|47|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_222.wav|4|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_105.wav|99|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_118.wav|15|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_288.wav|37|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_027.wav|8|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_269.wav|77|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_101.wav|68|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_325.wav|66|That did not go down well.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_374.wav|36|It would be quite nice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_037.wav|41|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_101.wav|103|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_220.wav|76|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_258.wav|56|It was a minor incident.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_176.wav|38|But we have come under attack.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_286.wav|84|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_390.wav|53|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_162.wav|30|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_161.wav|97|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_184.wav|95|I am a good player.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_248.wav|86|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_218.wav|69|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_083.wav|105|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_413.wav|20|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_307.wav|7|We have a high quality product.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_338.wav|79|It is their day.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_367.wav|64|There was a great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_057.wav|96|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_295.wav|99|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_098.wav|79|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_387.wav|48|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_237.wav|25|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_348.wav|76|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_211.wav|18|It's a big challenge for the audience.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_070.wav|39|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_100.wav|100|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_387.wav|37|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_197.wav|58|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_349.wav|86|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_399.wav|75|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_050.wav|36|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_002.wav|22|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_057.wav|38|It could take three days.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_390.wav|100|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_289.wav|44|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_106.wav|95|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_142.wav|78|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_127.wav|73|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_088.wav|99|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_317.wav|43|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_341.wav|46|I always said No.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_356.wav|92|So what could be better than becoming captain?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_363.wav|84|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_283.wav|73|So I did.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_043.wav|48|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_420.wav|98|What is going on?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_140.wav|26|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_277.wav|100|Blair is very positive at European Councils.

DUMMY2/p270/p270_437.wav|8|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_183.wav|18|Did they give any good advice?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_091.wav|15|It's not my fault.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_286.wav|9|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_324.wav|54|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_052.wav|37|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_340.wav|47|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_087.wav|66|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_288.wav|17|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_160.wav|49|This is good news for the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_078.wav|42|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_408.wav|48|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_081.wav|81|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_040.wav|46|I'll have to go out and impress.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_288.wav|95|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_011.wav|68|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

DUMMY2/p228/p228_321.wav|57|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_121.wav|29|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_371.wav|16|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_280.wav|76|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_338.wav|61|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_186.wav|105|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_027.wav|53|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_248.wav|80|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_059.wav|91|It's the best of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_384.wav|95|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_154.wav|16|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_411.wav|96|You wanted the evidence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_091.wav|28|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_354.wav|83|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_258.wav|51|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_180.wav|37|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_032.wav|74|But someone has to take them.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_200.wav|47|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_218.wav|92|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_080.wav|49|He said because people had invited him.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_273.wav|75|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_331.wav|74|I'd never heard anything like it before.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_013.wav|91|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_083.wav|79|It just isn't there.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_266.wav|93|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_011.wav|2|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_026.wav|18|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_356.wav|21|It comes down to the police in England.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_195.wav|52|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_238.wav|78|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_353.wav|7|We think the timing is good.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_186.wav|83|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_314.wav|93|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_001.wav|14|Please call Stella.  )
DUMMY2/p303/p303_073.wav|44|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_310.wav|103|The campaign was raucous.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_304.wav|93|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_028.wav|71|"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart."
DUMMY2/p333/p333_235.wav|64|What's it all about?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_081.wav|78|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_223.wav|46|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_052.wav|49|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_194.wav|91|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_030.wav|84|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_166.wav|56|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_322.wav|87|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_034.wav|91|I kept my side of the bargain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_190.wav|104|Its role is not to interfere.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_274.wav|86|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_142.wav|70|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_062.wav|16|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_266.wav|7|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_426.wav|89|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_240.wav|54|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_231.wav|35|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_280.wav|105|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_164.wav|79|And so did the rest of her team.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_154.wav|24|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_309.wav|95|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_068.wav|2|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_287.wav|12|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_406.wav|32|It's too close to call.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_156.wav|44|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_243.wav|59|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_164.wav|69|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_006.wav|87|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_390.wav|82|His instructions were clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_169.wav|27|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_251.wav|81|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_282.wav|62|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_215.wav|93|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_055.wav|32|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_080.wav|76|Did they give any good advice?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_287.wav|72|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_238.wav|44|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_048.wav|4|There are different cultures in different departments.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_066.wav|96|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_340.wav|18|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_009.wav|74|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_048.wav|53|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_093.wav|69|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_053.wav|100|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_208.wav|12|We were on top and could have won.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_204.wav|29|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_119.wav|85|This series is for real.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_128.wav|11|We are very pleased.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_012.wav|73|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_205.wav|93|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_073.wav|14|Robin Williams is very subdued.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_240.wav|42|He just wants to leave a legacy.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_355.wav|0|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_255.wav|0|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_150.wav|21|I'm going to win the gold.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_196.wav|64|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_253.wav|31|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_403.wav|17|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_224.wav|107|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_194.wav|43|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_276.wav|0|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_302.wav|100|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_398.wav|102|We expect to come through on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_288.wav|96|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_395.wav|26|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_350.wav|72|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_303.wav|59|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_259.wav|25|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_235.wav|13|This was never a support group.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_337.wav|33|It's so much more fun.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_351.wav|31|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_121.wav|47|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_152.wav|29|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_035.wav|83|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_438.wav|106|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_354.wav|70|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_196.wav|103|Nor should there have been.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_267.wav|48|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_261.wav|3|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_162.wav|52|That will reduce my chance of selection.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_336.wav|106|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_121.wav|86|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_125.wav|90|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_274.wav|19|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_265.wav|51|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_235.wav|48|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_282.wav|86|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_216.wav|80|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_361.wav|66|That's an old idea.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_307.wav|81|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_419.wav|92|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_433.wav|63|There is another important factor.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_372.wav|65|I took my chance.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_196.wav|75|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_013.wav|1|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_208.wav|17|This will be just another tax on motorists.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_014.wav|70|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_392.wav|66|There was someone on the floor.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_104.wav|21|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_083.wav|107|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_183.wav|14|One season, they might do well.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_190.wav|36|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_207.wav|3|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_395.wav|107|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_127.wav|45|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_411.wav|42|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_179.wav|97|I was delighted with Robbie.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_055.wav|67|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_292.wav|80|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_392.wav|106|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_174.wav|68|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_286.wav|96|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_196.wav|13|John Lennon is a very large industry.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_097.wav|99|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_247.wav|88|Stand by for action.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_098.wav|77|We have got a race.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_068.wav|95|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_023.wav|97|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_421.wav|104|The auction will be held tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_242.wav|56|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_233.wav|9|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_262.wav|100|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_195.wav|51|Our customers come first.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_068.wav|100|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_375.wav|66|Folk music is in her blood.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_297.wav|8|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_287.wav|70|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_192.wav|85|Retirement is on his mind.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_158.wav|35|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_194.wav|24|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_281.wav|0|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_109.wav|10|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_077.wav|29|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_314.wav|16|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_327.wav|2|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_206.wav|97|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_315.wav|38|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_062.wav|77|It has been an amazing day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_294.wav|25|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_253.wav|52|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_411.wav|14|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_086.wav|23|Self control is just one instalment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_016.wav|104|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_403.wav|34|We didn't make any of this up.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_344.wav|16|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_216.wav|35|He has made his base in Spain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_293.wav|46|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_109.wav|88|Success in Scotland is important.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_105.wav|27|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_103.wav|53|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_368.wav|32|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_073.wav|19|It really has left the town in shock.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_058.wav|86|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_291.wav|42|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_126.wav|96|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_160.wav|20|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_360.wav|17|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_206.wav|103|We will not break even.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_146.wav|3|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_225.wav|57|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_118.wav|101|We suffered a lot for seven years.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_183.wav|42|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_195.wav|71|"The group is separate from the Real IRA."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_235.wav|51|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_284.wav|89|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p260/p260_223.wav|81|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_287.wav|17|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_276.wav|97|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_212.wav|84|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_099.wav|6|This is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_090.wav|31|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_330.wav|81|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_145.wav|49|It's too big a risk to take.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_181.wav|57|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_004.wav|69|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_239.wav|35|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_171.wav|1|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_079.wav|47|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_250.wav|44|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_034.wav|62|Well, you might have a point.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_083.wav|46|The Hague is too good for him.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_011.wav|31|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_153.wav|104|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_338.wav|8|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_232.wav|36|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_033.wav|19|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_035.wav|39|I could not do it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_066.wav|19|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_108.wav|18|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_140.wav|78|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_103.wav|103|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_256.wav|23|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_015.wav|18|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_184.wav|46|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_362.wav|8|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_102.wav|32|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_148.wav|58|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_084.wav|37|He's very young and very keen to do well.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_085.wav|62|That never seemed likely.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_070.wav|103|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_377.wav|65|It would have to look for outside funding.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_001.wav|103|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_054.wav|59|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_122.wav|72|We are taking the back seat on this.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_419.wav|8|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_407.wav|89|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_390.wav|97|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_302.wav|29|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_333.wav|12|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_277.wav|90|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_133.wav|21|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_173.wav|36|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_323.wav|34|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_159.wav|26|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_007.wav|28|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_131.wav|56|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_261.wav|39|You look like a rugby player.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_220.wav|80|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_253.wav|87|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_251.wav|39|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_128.wav|22|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_361.wav|82|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_293.wav|97|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_076.wav|26|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_330.wav|1|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_265.wav|42|I made a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_194.wav|40|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_005.wav|66|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_041.wav|36|A week is a long time in politics.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_089.wav|37|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_341.wav|35|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_182.wav|1|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_123.wav|85|It is all up to the Members.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_097.wav|5|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_292.wav|98|I just made it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_294.wav|46|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_081.wav|17|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_062.wav|64|The chief constable is right.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_322.wav|25|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_171.wav|58|Was it a foul?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_104.wav|18|It was a disaster.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_317.wav|72|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_344.wav|42|O, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_317.wav|21|I will work on her.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_044.wav|55|Something old something new, as it were.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_240.wav|41|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_380.wav|82|I also thought, This is a feature film.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_269.wav|40|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_246.wav|7|Things were so intense in the studio.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_067.wav|62|I think it's more important to have fun.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_088.wav|16|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_215.wav|66|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_009.wav|61|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_398.wav|74|Detectives are still working on the case.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_158.wav|92|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_232.wav|23|Three others were wounded.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_021.wav|2|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_066.wav|33|We have got the school holidays on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_341.wav|67|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_273.wav|23|It is typical of me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_402.wav|69|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_244.wav|26|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_028.wav|68|That is just a load of baloney.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_381.wav|0|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_202.wav|73|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_124.wav|106|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_185.wav|15|She has the biggest part.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_238.wav|7|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_159.wav|10|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_279.wav|14|It was a minor incident.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_032.wav|24|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_267.wav|45|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_237.wav|1|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_075.wav|93|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_029.wav|38|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_420.wav|14|That is not the position of the British relatives.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_003.wav|73|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_368.wav|49|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_181.wav|88|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_154.wav|48|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_171.wav|61|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_309.wav|56|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_237.wav|81|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_220.wav|70|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_248.wav|40|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_151.wav|46|I just wasn't very good.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_155.wav|85|Things begin to spring to life.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_043.wav|12|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_343.wav|82|No one would believe him.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_040.wav|58|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_084.wav|76|That's why the ministers resigned.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_381.wav|19|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_294.wav|32|Strikers like to go to the ground.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_123.wav|11|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_054.wav|6|That is why this action has been taken.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_025.wav|70|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_099.wav|46|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_296.wav|17|That was the most annoying thing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_116.wav|47|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_220.wav|66|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_122.wav|93|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_386.wav|102|Construction would then begin.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_020.wav|42|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_312.wav|1|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_112.wav|89|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_375.wav|97|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_238.wav|83|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_329.wav|94|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_119.wav|61|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_337.wav|18|Sprinters are not fit.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_027.wav|65|He does not even trust his own members.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_045.wav|11|As a player you have to move on.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_315.wav|85|The film was great.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_067.wav|47|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_294.wav|55|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_281.wav|78|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_400.wav|95|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_402.wav|15|This is a very serious matter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_083.wav|4|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_017.wav|50|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_216.wav|26|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_196.wav|45|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_148.wav|28|It's a difficult one to comment on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_235.wav|86|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_362.wav|18|I cannot really commit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_053.wav|46|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_295.wav|31|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_154.wav|107|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_006.wav|18|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_219.wav|9|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_166.wav|65|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_051.wav|28|I found a fault and worked at it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_081.wav|86|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_009.wav|60|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_049.wav|20|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_423.wav|42|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_356.wav|98|Not so, it transpires.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_360.wav|82|It is not simple.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_102.wav|44|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_128.wav|38|This could be a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_042.wav|4|There can be no two ways about it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_128.wav|34|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_239.wav|86|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_223.wav|57|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_321.wav|76|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_037.wav|9|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_233.wav|74|So it should be.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_053.wav|33|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_124.wav|37|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_153.wav|58|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_219.wav|33|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_349.wav|38|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_042.wav|53|He does not even trust his own members.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_381.wav|102|Who is going to pay their wages?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_289.wav|90|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_451.wav|75|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_138.wav|10|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_029.wav|41|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_166.wav|86|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_246.wav|77|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_312.wav|52|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_104.wav|71|"It's not a new concept in jazz."
DUMMY2/p244/p244_244.wav|78|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_075.wav|82|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_333.wav|76|But when we do it is great.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_320.wav|66|He was released in March this year.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_283.wav|59|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_278.wav|97|The bookies have got it about right.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_249.wav|74|We've got to get this right.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_180.wav|98|I'm very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_015.wav|89|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_047.wav|50|A win is a win.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_066.wav|98|Get used to it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_175.wav|1|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_393.wav|6|It is for the same reason.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_064.wav|48|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_011.wav|90|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_321.wav|21|What on earth is happening to rugby?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_196.wav|56|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_355.wav|5|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_100.wav|5|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_465.wav|63|It is vital to clarify their role.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_383.wav|76|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_127.wav|85|Their opening was disastrous.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_106.wav|8|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_295.wav|90|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_069.wav|38|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_060.wav|92|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_023.wav|86|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_217.wav|84|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_376.wav|51|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_198.wav|28|These people just lost their child.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_367.wav|82|By now he was very ill with cancer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_315.wav|15|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_125.wav|94|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_156.wav|96|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_355.wav|98|It's been such a waste of money.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_107.wav|93|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_158.wav|14|Anyone can do the sums.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_402.wav|38|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_186.wav|76|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_099.wav|61|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_360.wav|46|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_308.wav|76|It was a simple question.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_235.wav|21|The players are obviously keen to do well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_019.wav|60|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_262.wav|7|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_233.wav|23|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_134.wav|15|The building was starting to come down.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_045.wav|14|Everything is possible in football.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_279.wav|66|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_083.wav|0|There was no way back for United after that.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_024.wav|72|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_162.wav|69|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_133.wav|70|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_319.wav|16|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_039.wav|35|This will save interest charges.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_174.wav|86|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_144.wav|33|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_249.wav|104|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_316.wav|21|She went home from school and never returned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_325.wav|18|I really have to go now.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_118.wav|64|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_001.wav|101|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_034.wav|24|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_077.wav|61|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_070.wav|64|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_098.wav|13|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_192.wav|40|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_009.wav|10|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_165.wav|106|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_325.wav|87|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_320.wav|54|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_323.wav|55|We have clearly become well established.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_099.wav|95|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_370.wav|45|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_037.wav|2|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_344.wav|1|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_324.wav|95|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_344.wav|61|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_118.wav|92|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_472.wav|24|He certainly did a good job!
DUMMY2/p340/p340_327.wav|74|Is that what it's about?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_430.wav|37|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_060.wav|52|It was a day she thought she would never see.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_050.wav|47|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_214.wav|62|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_171.wav|49|There's still time for that.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_099.wav|81|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_202.wav|31|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_267.wav|17|It's such a trial!
DUMMY2/p272/p272_361.wav|69|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_216.wav|92|I don't know how they make the weight.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_352.wav|21|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_213.wav|2|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_208.wav|75|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_147.wav|14|My daughter is an adult.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_291.wav|18|Was that not awful?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_040.wav|23|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_124.wav|18|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_101.wav|57|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_414.wav|79|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_346.wav|99|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_353.wav|101|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_187.wav|90|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_001.wav|30|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_024.wav|9|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_450.wav|95|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_299.wav|21|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_242.wav|4|It was just above the roof.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_124.wav|87|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_047.wav|7|He looks like an Afghan.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_214.wav|48|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_260.wav|74|They were his words.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_170.wav|32|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_012.wav|27|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_333.wav|57|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_221.wav|61|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_116.wav|39|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_119.wav|106|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_252.wav|80|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_443.wav|7|My aim is a top six finish.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_137.wav|36|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_077.wav|87|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_231.wav|86|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_165.wav|91|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_111.wav|105|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_279.wav|91|There is no substitute.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_171.wav|29|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_039.wav|78|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_227.wav|22|The team this year is going places.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_093.wav|18|We did it in one take.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_474.wav|14|They were impressive against France.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_101.wav|98|That is unlikely to happen.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_156.wav|9|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_049.wav|26|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_250.wav|50|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_159.wav|7|The two companies were not for sale.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_397.wav|37|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_052.wav|30|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_091.wav|62|But these things are happening now.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_132.wav|91|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_413.wav|11|I don't make it mystical.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_234.wav|39|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_048.wav|88|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_052.wav|104|The course record was in his name.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_144.wav|66|He is a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_323.wav|16|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_074.wav|18|It is surprising to come back this way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_135.wav|92|He added, We have the same desire.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_334.wav|106|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_247.wav|90|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_323.wav|95|The Project is far from that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_126.wav|17|This is just one example.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_201.wav|41|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_053.wav|12|Retirement, who knows?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_240.wav|38|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_300.wav|78|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_276.wav|3|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_193.wav|40|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_053.wav|107|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_124.wav|33|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_093.wav|62|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_051.wav|41|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_254.wav|18|It's about taking risks.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_060.wav|106|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_065.wav|47|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_025.wav|71|"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_386.wav|84|That set the tone.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_114.wav|90|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_104.wav|26|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_046.wav|98|My office is down there.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_114.wav|74|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_056.wav|32|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_050.wav|65|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_218.wav|55|Her experience is certainly limited.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_253.wav|37|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_172.wav|34|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_180.wav|51|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_345.wav|84|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_286.wav|101|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_046.wav|104|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_142.wav|53|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_211.wav|15|I was so relieved.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_379.wav|40|It looked like a river.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_140.wav|60|We are trying to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_230.wav|95|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_160.wav|64|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_241.wav|36|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_156.wav|56|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_247.wav|97|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_187.wav|26|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_171.wav|0|It is a body blow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_213.wav|16|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_420.wav|107|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_060.wav|35|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_203.wav|87|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_264.wav|100|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_225.wav|9|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_010.wav|103|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_250.wav|57|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_334.wav|6|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_043.wav|58|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_206.wav|90|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_215.wav|78|A team is a team.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_286.wav|26|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_018.wav|14|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p334/p334_244.wav|38|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_010.wav|56|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_395.wav|55|There's always a case.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_261.wav|52|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_357.wav|49|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_190.wav|82|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_246.wav|91|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_273.wav|91|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_379.wav|16|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_201.wav|48|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_382.wav|48|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_010.wav|44|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_325.wav|93|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_350.wav|81|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_360.wav|12|She looked very, very poor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_202.wav|79|He should be careful.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_089.wav|17|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_205.wav|92|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_325.wav|1|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_205.wav|39|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_007.wav|50|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_205.wav|18|We were never told it was already decided.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_351.wav|82|There was no discussion about it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_399.wav|15|That is why he is so special.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_252.wav|31|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_095.wav|67|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_066.wav|63|It is a great feeling right now.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_154.wav|89|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_402.wav|103|People ask about the concept of a team.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_102.wav|36|Movement has to take place.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_432.wav|7|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_331.wav|79|It will be fine.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_337.wav|86|I must make that clear.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_118.wav|55|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_350.wav|8|This statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_068.wav|10|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_007.wav|107|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_362.wav|32|We are in a global market.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_379.wav|31|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_160.wav|85|It was like a dream to be here.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_060.wav|49|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_350.wav|73|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_297.wav|49|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_375.wav|48|This should come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_349.wav|73|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_013.wav|57|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_115.wav|68|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_164.wav|107|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_435.wav|56|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_349.wav|75|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_053.wav|15|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_074.wav|31|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_064.wav|64|It has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_180.wav|9|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_084.wav|81|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_068.wav|47|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_284.wav|28|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_062.wav|43|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_152.wav|83|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_361.wav|100|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_235.wav|100|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_048.wav|26|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_255.wav|16|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_097.wav|59|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_008.wav|49|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_264.wav|52|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_004.wav|60|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_251.wav|38|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_411.wav|40|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_290.wav|32|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_257.wav|83|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_232.wav|89|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_274.wav|69|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_088.wav|64|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_328.wav|64|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_172.wav|58|Jamming would be equally difficult.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_111.wav|7|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_086.wav|35|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_071.wav|68|The cause of the crash was unclear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_290.wav|74|It wasn't really like that at all.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_178.wav|18|The funding is now there.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_142.wav|91|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_103.wav|71|"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_298.wav|23|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_369.wav|72|He had no problem with alcohol.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_263.wav|53|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_398.wav|2|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_180.wav|73|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_097.wav|4|The initial report has been completed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_144.wav|98|He's got me very well.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_134.wav|98|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_201.wav|87|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_054.wav|28|His voice is strong.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_390.wav|74|It is a challenge for all of us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_334.wav|12|We will be homeless.

DUMMY2/p288/p288_205.wav|47|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_133.wav|6|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_261.wav|1|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_227.wav|69|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_134.wav|82|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_183.wav|36|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_200.wav|93|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_214.wav|79|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_011.wav|15|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_009.wav|45|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_033.wav|8|That is the face of fear.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_077.wav|32|There may be reasons for it.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_300.wav|5|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_199.wav|17|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_105.wav|36|It's not a lack of confidence.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_084.wav|26|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_282.wav|4|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_134.wav|51|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_482.wav|48|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_162.wav|62|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_338.wav|6|It seems to go down well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_309.wav|100|We will deliver at director level.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_100.wav|58|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_406.wav|22|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_137.wav|4|I get the bus.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_328.wav|54|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_117.wav|99|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_265.wav|8|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_073.wav|99|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_356.wav|19|You have obviously got an answer to it.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_118.wav|85|I think they have to change that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_062.wav|4|It has been declared.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_034.wav|3|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_377.wav|97|And Rangers think they have problems.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_066.wav|26|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_241.wav|4|It may not be life long.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_411.wav|107|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_024.wav|52|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_008.wav|16|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_275.wav|34|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_173.wav|91|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_399.wav|104|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_245.wav|67|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_014.wav|86|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_345.wav|17|That is not the way we should operate.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_236.wav|58|I had another good day.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_064.wav|94|They are real.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_315.wav|102|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_173.wav|77|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_259.wav|53|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_173.wav|73|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_300.wav|49|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_044.wav|93|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_351.wav|70|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_201.wav|38|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_155.wav|104|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_155.wav|10|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_079.wav|5|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_413.wav|98|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_162.wav|105|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_042.wav|26|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_408.wav|89|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_096.wav|51|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_339.wav|69|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_015.wav|10|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_178.wav|57|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_328.wav|89|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_343.wav|84|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_185.wav|37|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_108.wav|7|It is a good lifestyle.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_410.wav|47|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_276.wav|90|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_002.wav|77|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_313.wav|52|For that reason cover should not be given.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_374.wav|70|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_063.wav|20|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_215.wav|61|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_005.wav|60|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_363.wav|100|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_009.wav|23|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_056.wav|106|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_230.wav|73|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_264.wav|37|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_067.wav|81|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_390.wav|32|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_012.wav|88|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_297.wav|9|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_271.wav|51|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_139.wav|70|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_402.wav|25|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_235.wav|45|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_204.wav|39|Or was it ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_350.wav|32|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_356.wav|10|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_162.wav|16|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_015.wav|16|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_017.wav|14|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p248/p248_137.wav|99|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_051.wav|27|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_343.wav|24|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_340.wav|50|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_370.wav|87|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_013.wav|71|"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "
DUMMY2/p267/p267_089.wav|0|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_114.wav|29|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_215.wav|99|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_342.wav|69|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_314.wav|69|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_343.wav|3|The market is the market.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_077.wav|0|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_401.wav|96|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_284.wav|32|My main intention was to write a funny comedy.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_071.wav|96|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_418.wav|56|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_268.wav|3|Then was the summer of their discontent.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_167.wav|37|We can't get over it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_062.wav|65|It happens from time to time.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_395.wav|63|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_253.wav|28|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_264.wav|18|There are no plans to change this.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_165.wav|99|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_134.wav|85|She is not the world champion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_415.wav|11|Neither could be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_037.wav|89|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_165.wav|61|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_240.wav|8|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_107.wav|22|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_283.wav|72|Teachers have been given the offer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_123.wav|65|It seemed like four hours.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_130.wav|68|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_281.wav|73|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_268.wav|83|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_018.wav|37|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_173.wav|51|We've got the top three.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_185.wav|50|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_194.wav|23|A final decision is expected by Friday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_172.wav|55|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_005.wav|23|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_247.wav|5|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_297.wav|17|We are being hijacked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_036.wav|20|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_266.wav|57|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_274.wav|105|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_039.wav|33|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_127.wav|70|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_110.wav|106|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_301.wav|62|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_142.wav|33|The other question is why the scaling down?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_034.wav|34|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_113.wav|14|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_420.wav|7|It's too close to call.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_163.wav|1|I was delighted with every one of them.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_200.wav|85|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_003.wav|33|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_038.wav|90|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_115.wav|19|Such a policy would be a disaster.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_115.wav|60|It has no place in football.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_369.wav|98|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_139.wav|89|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_080.wav|7|Our mother is very worried.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_239.wav|64|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_069.wav|73|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_049.wav|4|What would you do if you didn't work?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_209.wav|38|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_056.wav|92|He is helping police with their inquiries.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_350.wav|13|What's the problem with change?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_382.wav|25|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_215.wav|40|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_389.wav|27|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_334.wav|55|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_129.wav|84|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_198.wav|86|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_173.wav|18|I was very influenced by him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_369.wav|17|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_335.wav|76|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_315.wav|62|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_094.wav|60|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_346.wav|76|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_079.wav|33|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p298/p298_192.wav|68|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_180.wav|93|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_088.wav|42|Do something that you haven't done before.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_392.wav|20|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_252.wav|84|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_049.wav|98|It was a joy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_167.wav|4|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_190.wav|7|That's not fair to the supporters.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_066.wav|17|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_152.wav|94|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_271.wav|77|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_191.wav|39|The championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_357.wav|82|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_191.wav|91|We are seeking funds from government departments.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_186.wav|36|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_440.wav|37|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_423.wav|48|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_246.wav|41|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_221.wav|89|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_160.wav|88|He has gone back to school.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_206.wav|47|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_128.wav|56|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_219.wav|34|We had a huge response to that campaign.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_013.wav|3|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_313.wav|42|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_221.wav|44|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_414.wav|0|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_181.wav|2|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_309.wav|38|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_206.wav|63|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_096.wav|28|We are very very proud of Alain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_129.wav|82|That will be the case on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_358.wav|72|This is not a birthday party.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_344.wav|98|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_327.wav|11|The biggest thing is structure.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_303.wav|35|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_212.wav|104|I have no secrets.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_358.wav|67|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_259.wav|76|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_025.wav|82|This is a new era.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_289.wav|83|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_014.wav|102|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_084.wav|83|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_354.wav|51|There is access for disabled people.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_164.wav|38|That's as it should be.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_168.wav|85|That happens in boxing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_386.wav|54|It is the logical extension of audio description.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_311.wav|45|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_374.wav|76|I'm a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_237.wav|21|It's really good fun.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_319.wav|68|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_241.wav|5|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_063.wav|31|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_275.wav|102|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_212.wav|36|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_305.wav|96|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_396.wav|32|There was a substantial explosion.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_400.wav|46|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_040.wav|70|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_443.wav|63|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_378.wav|53|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_182.wav|5|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_275.wav|75|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_338.wav|47|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_358.wav|27|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_400.wav|51|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_131.wav|42|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_138.wav|84|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_093.wav|52|They had the appeal of TV stars.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_095.wav|64|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_111.wav|74|But we still don't know.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_064.wav|63|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_293.wav|53|They first met during a Step in London.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_043.wav|105|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_070.wav|52|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_100.wav|94|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_219.wav|25|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_356.wav|68|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_110.wav|102|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_148.wav|17|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_201.wav|47|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_005.wav|78|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_053.wav|102|Retirement, who knows?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_013.wav|49|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_325.wav|19|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_320.wav|95|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_010.wav|22|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_170.wav|51|They've got to get better.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_123.wav|99|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_069.wav|9|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_272.wav|78|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_348.wav|38|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_025.wav|78|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_396.wav|28|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_132.wav|58|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_106.wav|49|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_116.wav|44|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_104.wav|50|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_104.wav|62|I could not believe it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_373.wav|9|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_147.wav|79|It seems to have been an own goal.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_045.wav|77|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_176.wav|84|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_091.wav|94|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_128.wav|104|I can't speak for him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_293.wav|50|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_121.wav|89|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_153.wav|54|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_240.wav|44|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_049.wav|58|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_205.wav|8|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_100.wav|43|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_120.wav|89|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_074.wav|0|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_390.wav|45|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_111.wav|94|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_044.wav|72|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_048.wav|48|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_190.wav|67|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_376.wav|99|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_322.wav|76|But will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_205.wav|59|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_227.wav|46|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_130.wav|81|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_354.wav|7|He will go a long way.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_193.wav|0|If I was a woman.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_048.wav|68|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_019.wav|95|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_306.wav|96|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_369.wav|37|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_235.wav|96|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_349.wav|12|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_358.wav|51|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_211.wav|36|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_064.wav|71|"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_074.wav|51|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_125.wav|32|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_285.wav|27|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_060.wav|40|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_392.wav|29|That's not like us at all.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_048.wav|56|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_314.wav|82|It should not make the same mistake again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_405.wav|6|This is your chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_140.wav|46|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_290.wav|41|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_250.wav|70|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_178.wav|78|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_210.wav|66|He explained to his audience.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_242.wav|102|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_221.wav|62|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_134.wav|74|That was one very hard game.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_207.wav|58|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_428.wav|95|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_345.wav|107|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_285.wav|21|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_234.wav|77|They need to win a trophy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_111.wav|67|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_301.wav|60|He will be missed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_090.wav|43|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_046.wav|67|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_212.wav|61|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_198.wav|62|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_228.wav|102|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_160.wav|51|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_347.wav|7|Job losses were also announced.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_189.wav|18|The other was a football match.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_300.wav|32|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_087.wav|80|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_029.wav|49|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_023.wav|63|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_330.wav|77|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_070.wav|65|He has real potential.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_190.wav|62|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_063.wav|3|That could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_204.wav|62|I was on the pitch and everything.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_025.wav|27|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_037.wav|21|It should be the reverse.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_198.wav|83|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_344.wav|9|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_136.wav|15|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_370.wav|27|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_374.wav|65|It was exactly four months away.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_190.wav|96|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_035.wav|30|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_069.wav|95|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_240.wav|7|I am considered a teenager.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_354.wav|16|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_272.wav|16|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_412.wav|74|And Scotland is no different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_233.wav|19|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_121.wav|33|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_315.wav|76|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_309.wav|17|It is just like the stock market.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_299.wav|66|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_303.wav|95|It is the end of an adventure.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_279.wav|70|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_090.wav|74|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_297.wav|13|You can't get the experience in Austria.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_041.wav|44|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_012.wav|28|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_104.wav|100|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_099.wav|102|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_214.wav|13|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_025.wav|65|The west coast line is not just for middle England.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_173.wav|55|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_178.wav|46|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_104.wav|38|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_214.wav|87|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_261.wav|97|We are not too surprised.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_272.wav|88|It was a definite penalty.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_044.wav|97|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_153.wav|100|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_281.wav|9|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_205.wav|72|Ownership was the game.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_257.wav|30|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_223.wav|100|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_136.wav|74|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_045.wav|38|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_147.wav|54|They were even being used by primary pupils.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_425.wav|16|Nato will prevail.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_241.wav|43|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_133.wav|79|IT is called a killing in the trade.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_139.wav|25|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_296.wav|42|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_050.wav|82|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_168.wav|5|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_308.wav|62|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_120.wav|20|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_274.wav|5|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_223.wav|37|We were right to be afraid.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_077.wav|30|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_121.wav|9|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_131.wav|22|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_397.wav|75|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_388.wav|11|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_321.wav|63|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_251.wav|97|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_089.wav|64|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_106.wav|83|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_011.wav|25|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_133.wav|13|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_024.wav|53|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_382.wav|50|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_116.wav|24|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_335.wav|46|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_025.wav|101|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_170.wav|23|We are concerned that things should be safe.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_346.wav|87|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_215.wav|107|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_393.wav|41|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_130.wav|5|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_009.wav|71|"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "
DUMMY2/p317/p317_400.wav|97|It's a very special unit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_298.wav|34|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_175.wav|26|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_121.wav|107|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_220.wav|99|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_361.wav|17|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_112.wav|34|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_275.wav|104|We've been here before.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_143.wav|33|It was the crowning point of my career.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_042.wav|79|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_067.wav|57|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_097.wav|72|But he's not afraid to take risks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_214.wav|45|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_354.wav|35|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_217.wav|96|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_331.wav|15|The time commitment is the biggest thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_201.wav|36|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_266.wav|39|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_065.wav|99|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_354.wav|56|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_351.wav|45|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_239.wav|71|"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery."
DUMMY2/p273/p273_244.wav|56|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_289.wav|6|You are looking at him.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_063.wav|29|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_120.wav|57|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_057.wav|45|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_262.wav|44|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_232.wav|80|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_162.wav|40|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_257.wav|31|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_285.wav|93|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_321.wav|55|We lost to a poor team.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_219.wav|88|It was very, very frightening.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_048.wav|20|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_172.wav|105|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_299.wav|20|We lost a boy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_117.wav|39|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_378.wav|49|There were three boys and two girls.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_275.wav|89|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_325.wav|26|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_284.wav|4|Even then this game was not over.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_037.wav|17|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_066.wav|86|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_201.wav|84|He may need it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_031.wav|18|It's about the balance.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_358.wav|104|No decision on that was taken.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_275.wav|72|It used to be less than five minutes.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_144.wav|26|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_279.wav|72|We are not asking for the moon.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_399.wav|38|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_242.wav|3|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_253.wav|22|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_321.wav|26|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_103.wav|14|She has so much to offer.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_100.wav|52|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_092.wav|19|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_373.wav|45|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_022.wav|91|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_138.wav|69|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_065.wav|66|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_116.wav|84|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_278.wav|9|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_395.wav|89|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_166.wav|30|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_010.wav|60|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_354.wav|102|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_254.wav|40|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_280.wav|101|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_020.wav|106|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_032.wav|21|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_065.wav|71|"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_215.wav|46|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_140.wav|107|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_310.wav|54|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_121.wav|22|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_048.wav|67|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_318.wav|69|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_193.wav|19|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_224.wav|2|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_410.wav|13|I am looking forward to this film.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_291.wav|66|It was just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_183.wav|57|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_246.wav|74|The time for change is now.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_228.wav|8|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_027.wav|100|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_341.wav|78|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_091.wav|88|I didn't have the choice.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_104.wav|99|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_046.wav|91|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_052.wav|61|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_339.wav|9|He was not a big name.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_109.wav|97|We understand the changes in the world.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_202.wav|12|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_095.wav|57|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_139.wav|57|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_395.wav|60|They could have been told in advance.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_130.wav|93|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_156.wav|10|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_145.wav|88|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_225.wav|30|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_273.wav|84|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_407.wav|13|It will probably be my last, too.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_420.wav|105|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p232/p232_154.wav|96|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_214.wav|95|He lives in a neighbouring village.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_081.wav|74|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_431.wav|8|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_311.wav|10|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_329.wav|9|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_216.wav|106|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_084.wav|103|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_265.wav|45|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_048.wav|38|Times have changed, but have they improved?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_022.wav|19|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_371.wav|34|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_278.wav|55|Paul never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_396.wav|6|He will have something to say.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_228.wav|6|But we shall have to talk to him.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_214.wav|89|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_341.wav|36|It's just the way I play.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_084.wav|79|Drama is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_348.wav|72|Thirty people have applied for his job!
DUMMY2/p248/p248_205.wav|99|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_416.wav|62|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_036.wav|75|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_111.wav|46|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_326.wav|20|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_323.wav|22|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_452.wav|7|In fact, the reasons are simple.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_334.wav|4|You have to feel for the guy.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_029.wav|13|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_417.wav|104|I saw it in a different way.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_450.wav|106|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_105.wav|44|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_127.wav|32|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_122.wav|55|Consumers will also benefit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_065.wav|7|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_317.wav|17|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_051.wav|7|I had trouble with the producers.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_027.wav|59|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_036.wav|33|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_221.wav|48|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_382.wav|42|I don't want a burial service.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_097.wav|23|It has been hijacked.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_356.wav|29|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_258.wav|40|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_076.wav|77|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_076.wav|46|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_303.wav|16|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_345.wav|18|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_109.wav|26|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_262.wav|29|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_162.wav|84|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_311.wav|99|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_076.wav|8|It was a unanimous decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_169.wav|93|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_054.wav|9|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_309.wav|0|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_345.wav|63|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_101.wav|94|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_211.wav|85|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_211.wav|70|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_364.wav|70|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_186.wav|107|They've two children.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_108.wav|30|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_177.wav|80|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_283.wav|56|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_002.wav|44|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_251.wav|107|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_018.wav|54|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_278.wav|19|Something was plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_161.wav|56|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_393.wav|4|She returned home a few days later.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_140.wav|86|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_347.wav|11|It is coming on very well.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_282.wav|96|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_006.wav|35|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_289.wav|79|I have really noticed that this week.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_215.wav|38|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_025.wav|23|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_256.wav|49|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_081.wav|38|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_258.wav|12|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_003.wav|30|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_034.wav|100|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_397.wav|49|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_274.wav|21|There was no argument.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_142.wav|45|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_043.wav|20|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_210.wav|45|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_236.wav|33|The case was continued.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_240.wav|35|They need to win a trophy.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_030.wav|66|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_213.wav|7|Is it in the right place ?)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_180.wav|65|I've never had a year like this.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_277.wav|66|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_293.wav|43|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_026.wav|89|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_135.wav|94|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_366.wav|97|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_143.wav|68|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_066.wav|36|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_260.wav|51|I am deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_308.wav|16|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_134.wav|9|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_085.wav|31|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_204.wav|107|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_249.wav|58|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_041.wav|6|The impact was immediate.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_077.wav|74|Two options are being proposed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_140.wav|10|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_049.wav|102|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_247.wav|95|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_337.wav|67|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_034.wav|97|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_136.wav|30|Do you think they would be any better?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_026.wav|74|We are not prepared to do that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_121.wav|31|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_170.wav|78|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_057.wav|25|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_442.wav|106|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_234.wav|48|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_263.wav|1|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_230.wav|1|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_379.wav|17|That is why it's so lyrical.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_017.wav|35|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_345.wav|8|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_422.wav|11|Next year this time  we will be home.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_021.wav|25|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_250.wav|21|Actually, nothing much will change.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_331.wav|101|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_265.wav|100|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_267.wav|64|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_121.wav|17|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_124.wav|4|This is a most serious matter.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_036.wav|81|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_177.wav|66|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_217.wav|52|I do not see this so much as failure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_056.wav|72|I'm very angry about it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_111.wav|1|You just know it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_415.wav|77|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_027.wav|91|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_084.wav|21|I didn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_416.wav|107|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_194.wav|59|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_358.wav|29|Of course, we want to go home.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_171.wav|50|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_377.wav|72|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_108.wav|84|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_184.wav|100|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_022.wav|40|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_007.wav|69|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_286.wav|99|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_184.wav|69|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_320.wav|45|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_232.wav|38|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_233.wav|52|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_316.wav|36|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_358.wav|106|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_294.wav|54|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_111.wav|3|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_066.wav|48|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_473.wav|14|We will now look into its historical background.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_137.wav|45|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_347.wav|41|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_099.wav|96|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_077.wav|16|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_367.wav|41|They received a reply from their own managers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_414.wav|51|I don't believe that money is the answer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_115.wav|33|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_355.wav|52|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_248.wav|18|But that is for another day.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_399.wav|22|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_184.wav|85|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_256.wav|39|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_246.wav|90|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_064.wav|105|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_194.wav|49|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_098.wav|55|We're at home, which is important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_046.wav|96|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_200.wav|54|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_239.wav|24|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_094.wav|76|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_015.wav|107|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_040.wav|59|It's a great thing.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_012.wav|37|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_349.wav|79|But then the problems began.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_021.wav|65|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p310/p310_082.wav|17|They don't work anymore anyway.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_309.wav|52|It had happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_244.wav|61|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_006.wav|69|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_225.wav|97|I can't deny that fact.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_111.wav|76|It's just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_142.wav|77|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_139.wav|86|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_293.wav|64|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_182.wav|41|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_124.wav|86|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_095.wav|13|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_412.wav|14|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_324.wav|1|We've had our problems at the club.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_064.wav|29|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_318.wav|102|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_130.wav|3|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_031.wav|5|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_101.wav|50|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_251.wav|44|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_204.wav|61|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_291.wav|15|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_407.wav|66|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_303.wav|64|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_352.wav|84|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_179.wav|61|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_286.wav|52|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_071.wav|28|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_041.wav|35|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_160.wav|36|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_274.wav|50|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_036.wav|36|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_367.wav|96|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_357.wav|35|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_247.wav|45|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_372.wav|49|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_232.wav|102|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_322.wav|59|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_469.wav|14|Now that business is banned.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_029.wav|50|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_034.wav|63|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_272.wav|47|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_263.wav|20|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_467.wav|65|This is a big advantage.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_132.wav|43|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_070.wav|23|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_230.wav|5|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_229.wav|76|It doesn't take much.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_334.wav|105|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_092.wav|8|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_370.wav|33|It is a very big problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_324.wav|104|I told you so.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_355.wav|54|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_323.wav|83|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_003.wav|15|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_061.wav|29|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_065.wav|6|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_156.wav|103|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_342.wav|38|I knew he was dying.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_100.wav|99|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_162.wav|15|So is the rest of British sport.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_108.wav|72|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_101.wav|85|The rest was badminton.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_011.wav|93|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_052.wav|28|My position on the euro is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_071.wav|0|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_116.wav|87|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_239.wav|83|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_254.wav|85|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_324.wav|9|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_020.wav|39|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_115.wav|97|He had done his homework properly.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_095.wav|4|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_299.wav|47|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_315.wav|46|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_375.wav|93|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_298.wav|28|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_178.wav|39|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_073.wav|87|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_131.wav|83|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_302.wav|20|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_374.wav|99|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_390.wav|16|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_291.wav|85|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_089.wav|27|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_039.wav|79|It took two minutes to respond.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_086.wav|88|I said How much?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_441.wav|8|It is not over by any means.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_155.wav|7|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_410.wav|63|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_210.wav|8|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_312.wav|53|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_400.wav|91|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_248.wav|83|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_040.wav|22|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_011.wav|80|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_094.wav|52|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_055.wav|72|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_145.wav|6|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_159.wav|105|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_080.wav|39|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_400.wav|21|I love the feel of the place.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_104.wav|65|Jack was always going to win this one.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_392.wav|33|This is the last straw.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_087.wav|76|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_055.wav|104|We should not bring him into a dispute.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_004.wav|30|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_251.wav|23|Also, he was flawed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_039.wav|99|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_164.wav|26|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_309.wav|104|You could see he was thinking about it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_089.wav|35|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_348.wav|12|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_127.wav|3|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_383.wav|51|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_244.wav|106|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_141.wav|3|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_322.wav|33|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_311.wav|79|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_461.wav|75|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_408.wav|96|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_334.wav|21|It is my last chance.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_183.wav|77|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_144.wav|25|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_212.wav|78|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_323.wav|1|The committee's remit is far reaching.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_195.wav|47|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_300.wav|18|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_349.wav|45|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_013.wav|24|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_163.wav|92|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_006.wav|57|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_091.wav|63|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_231.wav|11|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_270.wav|105|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_118.wav|21|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_016.wav|32|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p268/p268_065.wav|87|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_061.wav|33|We are not the first to be affected.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_102.wav|71|"He takes the job."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_322.wav|5|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_112.wav|99|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_003.wav|5|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_158.wav|12|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_097.wav|88|He felt there was no case to answer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_327.wav|58|We could not have asked for any more.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_294.wav|92|You're going to die.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_047.wav|58|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_418.wav|46|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_191.wav|37|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_325.wav|79|There they were, making excuses for him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_248.wav|94|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_175.wav|25|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_242.wav|36|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_254.wav|33|I want to create events.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_105.wav|0|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_365.wav|14|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_086.wav|25|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_055.wav|102|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_348.wav|101|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_298.wav|73|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_400.wav|8|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_211.wav|105|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_375.wav|8|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_033.wav|3|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_112.wav|74|Are there any he wants to play?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_145.wav|0|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_133.wav|9|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_352.wav|16|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_332.wav|18|Well, that was the plan.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_325.wav|25|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_411.wav|24|We're not taking any risks.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_086.wav|58|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_230.wav|55|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_136.wav|5|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_211.wav|25|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_331.wav|6|I think they are right to be impatient.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_015.wav|17|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_259.wav|21|I'm not going to change from it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_009.wav|40|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_001.wav|39|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_414.wav|15|We actually had a laugh about that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_031.wav|76|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_047.wav|41|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_306.wav|40|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_118.wav|5|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_048.wav|90|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_390.wav|39|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_044.wav|44|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_255.wav|96|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_207.wav|92|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_204.wav|79|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_287.wav|61|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_298.wav|107|It all seemed so easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_147.wav|76|We haven't found out anything different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_150.wav|73|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_289.wav|75|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_182.wav|17|I'm not a magician.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_230.wav|105|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_039.wav|3|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_190.wav|55|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_090.wav|99|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_137.wav|76|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_006.wav|48|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_370.wav|52|I have come here to show support for the families.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_068.wav|94|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_333.wav|63|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_041.wav|50|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_215.wav|62|The dangers are very obvious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_405.wav|60|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_036.wav|72|The most important thing was to win today.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_335.wav|101|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_342.wav|49|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_013.wav|17|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_040.wav|35|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_043.wav|73|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_300.wav|90|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_071.wav|18|It is extremely fortunate.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_309.wav|13|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_202.wav|27|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_039.wav|106|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_237.wav|57|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_343.wav|43|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_171.wav|33|I'm really happy with how things went there.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_370.wav|57|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_322.wav|6|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_231.wav|53|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_093.wav|93|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_009.wav|39|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_272.wav|90|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_180.wav|48|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_014.wav|103|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_095.wav|104|Was it a signal?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_390.wav|25|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_335.wav|20|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_085.wav|107|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_136.wav|60|It is a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_009.wav|29|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_365.wav|20|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_131.wav|50|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_255.wav|95|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_130.wav|76|We need to make more inquiries about that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_143.wav|91|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_251.wav|92|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_112.wav|72|We are about to have our own Parliament.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_155.wav|36|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_003.wav|101|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_021.wav|9|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_154.wav|47|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_287.wav|10|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_163.wav|62|I'm not sure.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_137.wav|6|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_077.wav|88|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_350.wav|97|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_056.wav|58|I think it is a sensible change.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_120.wav|47|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_059.wav|24|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_089.wav|46|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_070.wav|54|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_063.wav|100|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_053.wav|84|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_266.wav|69|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_134.wav|24|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_026.wav|82|I want to go home.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_020.wav|70|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_296.wav|44|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_086.wav|74|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_010.wav|24|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_164.wav|30|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_281.wav|5|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_336.wav|37|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_009.wav|0|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_017.wav|81|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_149.wav|23|We had to take action to protect them.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_301.wav|9|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_092.wav|21|He's got the same story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_121.wav|38|It's not one for the purist.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_014.wav|76|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_208.wav|43|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_321.wav|94|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_340.wav|75|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_211.wav|35|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_171.wav|81|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_330.wav|62|She is a great talent.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_161.wav|72|I have worked with him on projects.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_227.wav|33|That, though, was then.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_296.wav|103|That would have been too easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_330.wav|23|He's very young but he is growing up.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_294.wav|52|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_164.wav|51|The elections should have no role in this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_262.wav|52|There would be a north and south division.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_142.wav|107|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_267.wav|89|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_140.wav|59|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_166.wav|49|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_239.wav|69|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_017.wav|105|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_182.wav|92|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_117.wav|94|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_067.wav|28|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_007.wav|70|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_416.wav|27|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_242.wav|66|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_061.wav|57|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_049.wav|6|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_314.wav|67|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_301.wav|6|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_343.wav|60|That must have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_133.wav|75|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_224.wav|75|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_167.wav|89|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_192.wav|64|I have been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_085.wav|54|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_403.wav|1|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_125.wav|14|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_040.wav|8|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_194.wav|54|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_362.wav|104|Europe is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_219.wav|97|Thus far we have received no complaints.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_034.wav|61|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_383.wav|96|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_001.wav|43|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_372.wav|93|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_027.wav|5|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_277.wav|96|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_331.wav|44|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_332.wav|39|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_349.wav|35|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_071.wav|83|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_086.wav|6|That is my preference.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_205.wav|36|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_075.wav|72|I will wait until later.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_082.wav|12|It is truly fields of miracles.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_290.wav|97|They are in care for a reason.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_314.wav|6|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_289.wav|77|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_383.wav|104|Are there muscular problems?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_202.wav|52|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_370.wav|91|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_085.wav|95|The result is a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_078.wav|23|I can live with just the one.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_121.wav|85|It's very ingenious.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_378.wav|8|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_050.wav|80|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_113.wav|47|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_264.wav|84|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_123.wav|26|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_366.wav|104|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_369.wav|102|I am really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_222.wav|91|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p246/p246_157.wav|5|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_219.wav|74|Everyone here is heartbroken.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_370.wav|86|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_160.wav|84|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_130.wav|60|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_037.wav|49|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_227.wav|26|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_230.wav|34|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_351.wav|103|It was quite rigorous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_373.wav|33|The cause is just.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_248.wav|50|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_414.wav|11|So what was he really doing?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_077.wav|15|That is her job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_351.wav|84|He agreed with my proposal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_328.wav|87|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_315.wav|22|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_126.wav|78|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_315.wav|10|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_154.wav|50|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_294.wav|0|I felt like I was a child.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_075.wav|55|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_241.wav|29|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_066.wav|75|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_176.wav|7|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_063.wav|57|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_363.wav|48|The actual increases will be announced next month.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_345.wav|24|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_288.wav|87|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_020.wav|24|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_026.wav|32|She is employed on short-term contracts.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_224.wav|40|It's the Tate.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_164.wav|22|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_197.wav|105|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_317.wav|101|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_083.wav|87|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_093.wav|23|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_323.wav|59|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_084.wav|44|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_241.wav|89|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_082.wav|46|That is in the public domain.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_042.wav|71|"A neighbour said."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_039.wav|96|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_085.wav|75|Change will however have to be in euros.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_082.wav|31|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_156.wav|106|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_372.wav|92|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_206.wav|39|Two years later, she was dead.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_033.wav|24|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_092.wav|82|They don't work anymore anyway.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_192.wav|73|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_285.wav|34|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_291.wav|27|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_108.wav|2|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_344.wav|22|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_119.wav|27|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_374.wav|55|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_211.wav|42|That's hard for a woman.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_109.wav|74|Another man said, It was horrible.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_328.wav|25|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_070.wav|40|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_277.wav|101|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_010.wav|53|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_011.wav|98|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_268.wav|54|It's an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_100.wav|90|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_365.wav|74|We wanted to do something different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_033.wav|56|That is the face of fear.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_166.wav|57|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_329.wav|69|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_210.wav|78|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_442.wav|75|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_284.wav|30|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_380.wav|35|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_296.wav|62|I was first in the door.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_245.wav|37|I was a lucky man tonight.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_370.wav|41|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_285.wav|52|There was just fire all around me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_322.wav|63|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_324.wav|63|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_352.wav|78|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_109.wav|24|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_247.wav|48|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_394.wav|53|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_086.wav|14|It makes for an interesting conference.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_166.wav|75|He is not a team captain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_209.wav|35|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_160.wav|16|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_183.wav|26|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_390.wav|63|Rugby has an extended run.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_279.wav|85|The deadline is real and absolute.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_067.wav|102|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_162.wav|60|I don't know how they do it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_242.wav|34|I went home and wrote about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_368.wav|62|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_170.wav|45|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_190.wav|22|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_348.wav|85|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_360.wav|37|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_217.wav|94|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_203.wav|77|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_106.wav|30|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_336.wav|53|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_132.wav|39|I told him I was a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_159.wav|73|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_123.wav|9|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_239.wav|13|That was six years ago.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_270.wav|33|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_250.wav|94|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_009.wav|26|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_346.wav|74|You know the score.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_087.wav|91|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_340.wav|39|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_096.wav|69|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_166.wav|28|There is no internal damage.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_352.wav|13|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_372.wav|23|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_337.wav|75|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_169.wav|67|Was this element always there ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_147.wav|26|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_098.wav|10|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_005.wav|41|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_172.wav|87|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_316.wav|45|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_449.wav|75|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_002.wav|97|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_141.wav|6|Hard it will be.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_215.wav|54|Every game against New Zealand is.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_208.wav|70|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_174.wav|53|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_252.wav|40|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_014.wav|73|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_259.wav|39|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_145.wav|68|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_290.wav|47|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_278.wav|5|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_266.wav|44|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_204.wav|42|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_312.wav|19|I am not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_047.wav|12|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_311.wav|66|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_154.wav|36|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_121.wav|4|Someone else has now got them.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_296.wav|18|I have nothing to say on that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_195.wav|30|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_274.wav|4|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_235.wav|7|It had all been arranged.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_036.wav|24|It was just appalling luck.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_324.wav|59|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_410.wav|66|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_406.wav|10|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_129.wav|3|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_081.wav|76|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_126.wav|70|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_257.wav|25|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_024.wav|78|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_096.wav|58|We are trying to establish a date.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_055.wav|89|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_033.wav|21|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_271.wav|87|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_350.wav|98|Bomber was not amused.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_296.wav|27|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_286.wav|51|Some may end up in hospital.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_050.wav|15|But this was refused.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_420.wav|0|I've got my own ideas.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_011.wav|26|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_326.wav|0|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_030.wav|1|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_274.wav|29|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_080.wav|9|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_289.wav|23|They have got their position, we have got our position.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_010.wav|79|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_064.wav|69|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_312.wav|0|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_032.wav|36|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_157.wav|63|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_030.wav|78|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_370.wav|104|But who was driving it?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_109.wav|59|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_257.wav|45|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_111.wav|36|They are at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_044.wav|65|It does not stop here.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_373.wav|102|I will never get over his death.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_167.wav|1|I was proud of our lads.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_398.wav|53|People have a wish to charge twice.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_376.wav|49|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_217.wav|21|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_293.wav|29|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_250.wav|33|They seem to turn up for them.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_122.wav|70|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_036.wav|73|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_056.wav|34|They may have been murdered.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_398.wav|79|I am delighted to have her back home.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_349.wav|25|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_207.wav|78|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_076.wav|56|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_087.wav|85|He was caught and fired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_047.wav|21|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_321.wav|56|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_232.wav|95|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_405.wav|91|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_296.wav|12|After that he became more romantic.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_125.wav|46|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_418.wav|17|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_383.wav|47|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_357.wav|6|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_057.wav|85|There was only silence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_093.wav|14|On Saturday, it was much the same.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_019.wav|11|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_093.wav|11|It doesn't always work that way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_181.wav|51|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_039.wav|71|"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_371.wav|62|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_231.wav|64|It's because they can't understand the language.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_388.wav|55|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_043.wav|8|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_194.wav|75|I had too much to drink.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_337.wav|54|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_325.wav|55|Murray plays down return
DUMMY2/p303/p303_118.wav|44|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_338.wav|13|They are with their father.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_166.wav|76|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_023.wav|25|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_031.wav|104|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_044.wav|18|Labour has been found out on public spending.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_194.wav|81|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_255.wav|83|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_126.wav|36|Scottish Life was there over one year.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_353.wav|79|That there would be discussions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_272.wav|32|This idea has been around for four years.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_299.wav|35|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_417.wav|14|Shelter also supports the reform.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_310.wav|51|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_365.wav|19|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_237.wav|95|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_074.wav|86|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_479.wav|14|That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_142.wav|64|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_016.wav|38|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_270.wav|55|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_152.wav|22|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_243.wav|81|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_369.wav|97|The actors just have to say so.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_034.wav|82|We had to laugh.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_004.wav|20|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_360.wav|105|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_138.wav|55|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_376.wav|70|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_125.wav|4|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_005.wav|83|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_413.wav|24|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_124.wav|56|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_218.wav|15|Gas is too expensive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_379.wav|76|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_195.wav|94|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_080.wav|11|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_358.wav|77|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_119.wav|33|This time it was out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_235.wav|84|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_001.wav|41|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_150.wav|51|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_364.wav|62|She was just that sort of person.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_134.wav|6|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_072.wav|60|They couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_203.wav|25|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_414.wav|6|It's not going to last five minutes.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_045.wav|63|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_146.wav|44|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_431.wav|105|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_237.wav|94|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_156.wav|3|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_196.wav|22|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_427.wav|89|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_139.wav|65|He said some things which were better left alone.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_313.wav|17|What, then, is the real thing?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_174.wav|92|The driver was unhurt.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_283.wav|50|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_079.wav|68|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_249.wav|59|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_318.wav|11|If you're going to do it, do it right.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_208.wav|39|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_056.wav|22|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_355.wav|21|We will need to look at that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_160.wav|76|He'd never run the distance before.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_134.wav|55|We're currently looking at the level of support.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_128.wav|98|The criteria have changed.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_275.wav|16|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_176.wav|62|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_148.wav|84|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_313.wav|31|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_071.wav|40|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_082.wav|20|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_201.wav|40|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_210.wav|9|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_217.wav|62|Is it in the right place?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_233.wav|24|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_064.wav|4|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_369.wav|46|As it happened, it was much more than that.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_225.wav|59|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_218.wav|70|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_339.wav|1|The result today is an impasse.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_250.wav|1|The board of governors must act.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_129.wav|78|He wanted to record the group.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_282.wav|80|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_300.wav|25|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_009.wav|32|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
DUMMY2/p241/p241_026.wav|86|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_112.wav|75|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_207.wav|36|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_056.wav|6|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_238.wav|63|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_268.wav|75|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_070.wav|72|I love a clever reader.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_398.wav|94|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_431.wav|95|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_088.wav|60|They couldn't keep it together.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_348.wav|95|It is a matter of clarity.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_088.wav|87|It is time for new ways for the church.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_234.wav|21|He is the saviour of South Africa.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_281.wav|42|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_333.wav|38|The attack was totally unprovoked.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_311.wav|2|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_260.wav|86|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_233.wav|50|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_124.wav|36|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_201.wav|73|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_288.wav|72|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_167.wav|78|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_321.wav|85|I read about it in the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_055.wav|16|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_237.wav|89|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_303.wav|72|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_160.wav|90|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_373.wav|95|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_316.wav|52|A report on their property is due within days.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_024.wav|28|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_152.wav|43|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_143.wav|78|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_075.wav|15|But there is good and bad.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_259.wav|58|He is a right bastard.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_053.wav|18|I needed to get away.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_181.wav|12|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_162.wav|99|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_383.wav|92|Our proposals are fully costed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_097.wav|20|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_347.wav|48|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_120.wav|43|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_269.wav|80|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_218.wav|76|It's not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_087.wav|26|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_251.wav|65|I hit you there.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_245.wav|3|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_395.wav|72|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_194.wav|105|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_270.wav|35|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_254.wav|102|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_345.wav|9|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_210.wav|23|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_112.wav|76|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_256.wav|46|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_185.wav|49|He had come of age.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_067.wav|1|We gave everything we had.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_162.wav|3|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_049.wav|95|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_070.wav|76|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_322.wav|60|It has been only average.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_180.wav|95|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_320.wav|17|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_274.wav|2|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_275.wav|91|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_145.wav|104|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_230.wav|97|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_341.wav|95|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_299.wav|49|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_377.wav|70|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_356.wav|56|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_251.wav|36|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_416.wav|4|The whole process was so different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_193.wav|73|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_308.wav|27|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_270.wav|28|Subs not used, McGraw.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_368.wav|106|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_247.wav|104|Everything else is the same.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_077.wav|18|That should be fun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_318.wav|43|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_361.wav|75|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_310.wav|12|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_257.wav|36|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_219.wav|29|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_402.wav|27|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_269.wav|20|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_217.wav|31|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_446.wav|32|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_303.wav|60|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_276.wav|75|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_262.wav|82|But this is different.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_237.wav|54|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_106.wav|42|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_321.wav|52|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_104.wav|72|Four people died instantly.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_159.wav|64|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_128.wav|42|It was my shortest audition.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_391.wav|41|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_011.wav|58|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_371.wav|58|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p293/p293_373.wav|23|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_132.wav|104|I'm deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_255.wav|8|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_211.wav|103|But he's not afraid to take risks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_080.wav|6|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_178.wav|84|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_283.wav|71|"It happens from time to time."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_182.wav|59|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_252.wav|34|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_344.wav|57|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_136.wav|45|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_033.wav|105|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_018.wav|87|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_096.wav|78|He is in the US.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_099.wav|0|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_113.wav|57|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_134.wav|8|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_009.wav|67|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_267.wav|12|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_314.wav|34|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_324.wav|74|Will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_142.wav|79|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_095.wav|70|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_326.wav|60|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_070.wav|98|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_053.wav|39|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_084.wav|35|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_379.wav|7|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_423.wav|106|You didn't need to pay.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_074.wav|40|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_222.wav|30|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_375.wav|56|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_094.wav|57|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_134.wav|63|It was a good game to watch.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_114.wav|28|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_229.wav|58|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_165.wav|41|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_055.wav|76|Her role in it was small.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_129.wav|59|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_316.wav|48|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_251.wav|18|Police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_178.wav|74|We can't determine that clearly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_234.wav|52|The labour side has developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_096.wav|67|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_116.wav|59|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_349.wav|60|Where did that finish?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_001.wav|46|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_038.wav|82|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_138.wav|31|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_084.wav|86|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_488.wav|24|The Israeli military denied the claim.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_113.wav|93|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_035.wav|63|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_349.wav|101|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_271.wav|85|She was so full of life.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_080.wav|16|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_250.wav|11|The members have clearly spoken.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_408.wav|38|It remains in public ownership.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_153.wav|50|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_117.wav|87|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_011.wav|38|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_315.wav|6|The Old Firm are growing.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_157.wav|35|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_306.wav|20|I can give no comment.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_025.wav|31|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_373.wav|48|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_323.wav|63|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_274.wav|71|"It is not a process which can be completed overnight."
DUMMY2/p311/p311_175.wav|4|His only reply was a laugh.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_187.wav|28|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_158.wav|79|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_390.wav|2|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_176.wav|76|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_322.wav|102|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_107.wav|73|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_154.wav|67|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_405.wav|52|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_258.wav|24|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_162.wav|11|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_254.wav|103|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p362/p362_360.wav|15|I am feeling on top of the world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_183.wav|64|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_413.wav|1|Their welfare is very important to us.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_136.wav|85|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_250.wav|82|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_114.wav|76|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_128.wav|72|That is my role.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_375.wav|70|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_286.wav|45|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_178.wav|53|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_318.wav|65|I just felt like a dead loss.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_410.wav|36|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_186.wav|65|She runs like her mother.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_206.wav|60|No-one has used it since then.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_392.wav|25|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_354.wav|38|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_017.wav|6|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_141.wav|1|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_030.wav|48|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_201.wav|24|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_112.wav|19|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_177.wav|95|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_277.wav|20|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_323.wav|23|That's just the kind of thing we have.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_185.wav|61|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_110.wav|100|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_056.wav|8|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_265.wav|54|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_185.wav|70|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_319.wav|107|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_228.wav|59|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_428.wav|37|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_104.wav|46|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_293.wav|51|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_365.wav|97|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_052.wav|38|It is a form of physical exercise.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_089.wav|53|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_360.wav|26|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_126.wav|16|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_171.wav|98|However, they should not come as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_020.wav|16|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_262.wav|31|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_040.wav|64|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_131.wav|92|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_078.wav|26|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_136.wav|8|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_250.wav|27|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_191.wav|10|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_309.wav|24|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_255.wav|40|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_058.wav|75|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_233.wav|35|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_128.wav|14|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_127.wav|93|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_039.wav|69|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_447.wav|32|No further details of expansion plans were given.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_222.wav|36|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_238.wav|106|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_352.wav|81|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_290.wav|37|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_322.wav|18|You'll have to wait and see.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_008.wav|62|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_235.wav|105|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_038.wav|68|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_124.wav|9|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_269.wav|64|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_359.wav|36|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_234.wav|44|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_394.wav|46|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_116.wav|5|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_206.wav|87|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_113.wav|21|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_157.wav|10|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_228.wav|79|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_110.wav|7|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_322.wav|17|But we were wrong.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_286.wav|104|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_057.wav|99|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_069.wav|33|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_442.wav|63|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_016.wav|14|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_126.wav|32|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_319.wav|22|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_228.wav|104|I could not believe what they were saying.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_352.wav|79|The duties are still to be drawn up.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_142.wav|86|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_063.wav|47|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_146.wav|70|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_215.wav|16|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_155.wav|13|That takes time and games and practice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_266.wav|97|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_234.wav|22|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_064.wav|83|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_361.wav|28|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_095.wav|59|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_378.wav|20|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_165.wav|66|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_409.wav|8|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_076.wav|68|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_099.wav|44|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_294.wav|51|I don't think we could have expected better.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_207.wav|39|It is not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_352.wav|104|They are not falling now.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_356.wav|78|However, it does not tell the full story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_044.wav|10|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_198.wav|2|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_427.wav|50|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_129.wav|89|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_250.wav|76|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_112.wav|32|It's not a quick fix.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_154.wav|35|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_216.wav|90|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_291.wav|107|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_307.wav|57|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_293.wav|35|I would rather look at him.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_087.wav|93|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_068.wav|99|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_439.wav|100|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_080.wav|33|I don't understand it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_102.wav|57|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_395.wav|62|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_189.wav|95|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_342.wav|54|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_278.wav|13|It has been only average.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_014.wav|23|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_418.wav|72|We would all have liked to run.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_183.wav|59|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_258.wav|46|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_202.wav|100|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_413.wav|106|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_051.wav|61|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_415.wav|6|I am happy with my form.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_163.wav|89|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_086.wav|27|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p308/p308_318.wav|107|So, the question is, is it any good?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_348.wav|58|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_187.wav|18|This could be wonderful.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_109.wav|107|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_224.wav|17|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_180.wav|105|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_154.wav|11|Next league matches Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_248.wav|3|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_187.wav|31|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_244.wav|62|I won't go back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_303.wav|89|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_049.wav|51|All the oil companies are talking together.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_022.wav|84|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_031.wav|102|I don't believe you own anything.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_037.wav|101|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_152.wav|84|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_414.wav|78|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_105.wav|91|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_202.wav|105|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_053.wav|4|We will miss him very much.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_269.wav|54|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_059.wav|60|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_368.wav|46|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_301.wav|57|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_213.wav|57|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_347.wav|21|That will just be the beginning.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_269.wav|65|Others get through it.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_358.wav|68|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_069.wav|15|It's more relaxing this way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_128.wav|93|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_463.wav|100|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_008.wav|60|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_127.wav|5|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_163.wav|100|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_248.wav|34|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_013.wav|34|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_109.wav|86|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_082.wav|80|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_158.wav|69|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_290.wav|88|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_201.wav|102|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_155.wav|79|I wish they would commit to us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_325.wav|74|There was nothing sinister in that.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_026.wav|87|He got very close tonight.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_393.wav|76|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_113.wav|5|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_304.wav|28|It makes a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_092.wav|102|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_357.wav|26|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_047.wav|98|There can be no dispute about our history.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_373.wav|91|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_081.wav|45|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p288/p288_285.wav|47|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_310.wav|101|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_041.wav|96|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_022.wav|4|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_327.wav|35|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_259.wav|88|That's the last thing he will do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_243.wav|72|There is no pressure from anyone now.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_118.wav|75|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_098.wav|27|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_372.wav|38|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_261.wav|48|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_198.wav|41|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_382.wav|47|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_120.wav|0|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_165.wav|65|It's been my life.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_146.wav|59|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_157.wav|1|But it could have been written for her.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_158.wav|10|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_330.wav|29|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_252.wav|7|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_158.wav|66|But my heart is in athletics.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_409.wav|36|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_333.wav|65|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_416.wav|49|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_317.wav|87|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_123.wav|33|Last night he became one of the hunted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_161.wav|38|The investment will be in the food.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_149.wav|52|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_273.wav|94|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_186.wav|100|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_333.wav|37|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_107.wav|76|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_245.wav|53|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_200.wav|45|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_130.wav|47|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_061.wav|72|Trading Places was too obvious.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_262.wav|2|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_411.wav|95|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_378.wav|69|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_318.wav|14|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_083.wav|26|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_288.wav|70|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_133.wav|84|It's an amazing landscape!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_058.wav|0|It's just the timing of the game.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_187.wav|47|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_014.wav|81|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_313.wav|104|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_270.wav|56|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_255.wav|54|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_003.wav|10|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_362.wav|67|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_421.wav|15|I want to help other women.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_128.wav|3|The end result is the same.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_366.wav|13|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_143.wav|50|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_098.wav|71|"We live by the rule of law."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_167.wav|66|It really is a gift to the world.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_414.wav|104|Would it really be good to shorten it?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_197.wav|42|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_115.wav|20|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_381.wav|66|They have learned from that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_200.wav|86|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_221.wav|9|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_137.wav|12|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_181.wav|107|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_261.wav|47|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_090.wav|104|He had just returned from a run.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_041.wav|22|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_006.wav|99|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_302.wav|66|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_211.wav|32|They have known the hard times.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_052.wav|78|The pressure on the players will build.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_118.wav|78|Otherwise, the market may come back.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_417.wav|95|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_377.wav|50|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_123.wav|47|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_179.wav|9|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_040.wav|60|It's not been a good year.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_465.wav|100|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_084.wav|101|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_111.wav|32|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_234.wav|68|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_323.wav|57|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_113.wav|34|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_149.wav|78|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_292.wav|49|There are so many people to thank.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_170.wav|64|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_122.wav|27|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_146.wav|52|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_242.wav|39|She will attend in July.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_109.wav|4|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_222.wav|95|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_171.wav|4|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_117.wav|61|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_069.wav|25|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_253.wav|65|He is keen to stay in public service.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_331.wav|7|Are they free ?)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_044.wav|17|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_017.wav|51|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_417.wav|24|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_030.wav|70|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_275.wav|106|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_320.wav|58|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_385.wav|6|Does it really matter?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_205.wav|9|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_359.wav|33|He was, but only just.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_113.wav|8|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_096.wav|4|Surely history will not repeat itself.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_278.wav|90|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_144.wav|57|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_250.wav|30|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_060.wav|17|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_247.wav|70|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_460.wav|14|The boys are mentally focused.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_128.wav|53|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_296.wav|67|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_084.wav|90|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_310.wav|49|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_194.wav|97|That option cannot be ruled out.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_177.wav|96|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_330.wav|2|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_080.wav|41|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_411.wav|97|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_091.wav|93|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_355.wav|13|That didn't happen for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_160.wav|28|I think we believed the tie was won.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_323.wav|101|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_005.wav|29|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_109.wav|41|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_178.wav|7|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_011.wav|57|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_250.wav|69|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_394.wav|15|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_378.wav|11|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_347.wav|102|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_271.wav|42|Who reminded him about the score?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_013.wav|106|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_390.wav|41|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_355.wav|76|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_243.wav|68|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_269.wav|69|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_066.wav|78|There is a lot to be done.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_041.wav|84|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_104.wav|58|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_391.wav|42|I believe that gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_374.wav|20|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_160.wav|25|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_260.wav|1|The question is, Is that a negative?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_076.wav|22|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_018.wav|56|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_193.wav|96|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_254.wav|20|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_220.wav|62|They are still going to be impulsive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_234.wav|58|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_332.wav|47|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_357.wav|18|We're talking to the US.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_287.wav|57|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_272.wav|73|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_384.wav|35|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_317.wav|50|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_326.wav|62|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_328.wav|46|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_243.wav|102|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_234.wav|57|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_216.wav|18|They know the language.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_240.wav|32|You will have seen the adverts.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_287.wav|59|That could change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_255.wav|57|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_383.wav|52|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_257.wav|84|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_119.wav|42|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_090.wav|27|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_108.wav|4|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_245.wav|36|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_157.wav|27|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_230.wav|94|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_331.wav|16|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_406.wav|17|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_315.wav|97|They didn't have a care in the world.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_434.wav|14|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_039.wav|101|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_135.wav|96|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_014.wav|39|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_037.wav|8|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_278.wav|46|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_258.wav|19|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_340.wav|94|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_028.wav|60|You have been warned.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_112.wav|71|"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election."
DUMMY2/p298/p298_002.wav|68|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_061.wav|44|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_052.wav|99|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_095.wav|60|It's not a game.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_237.wav|47|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_247.wav|105|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_316.wav|49|The company's in good shape.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_375.wav|4|We don't ask for much.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_197.wav|0|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_304.wav|99|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_166.wav|67|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_219.wav|73|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_356.wav|55|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_294.wav|23|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_026.wav|28|The message was clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_434.wav|100|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_389.wav|104|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_141.wav|107|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_145.wav|50|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_021.wav|101|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_098.wav|63|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_106.wav|47|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_314.wav|95|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_076.wav|2|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_346.wav|55|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_120.wav|66|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_424.wav|8|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_232.wav|44|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_137.wav|81|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_401.wav|41|It really is a gift to the world.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_129.wav|79|How do you take them away?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_248.wav|104|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_127.wav|33|The truth, of course, is very different.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_331.wav|39|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_299.wav|61|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_173.wav|69|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_260.wav|3|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_205.wav|3|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_396.wav|17|It might not survive the process.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_330.wav|93|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_058.wav|78|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_256.wav|44|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_150.wav|35|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_120.wav|55|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_060.wav|2|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_087.wav|44|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_148.wav|49|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_050.wav|0|It is a different animal.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_417.wav|19|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_176.wav|91|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_008.wav|17|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_346.wav|33|Our season is not over.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_159.wav|24|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_295.wav|44|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_351.wav|35|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_038.wav|35|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_226.wav|76|From our point of view, it's the right time.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_210.wav|51|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_081.wav|73|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_084.wav|48|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_124.wav|17|Five in a month isn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_149.wav|9|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_093.wav|5|It is home-grown.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_276.wav|82|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_306.wav|73|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_410.wav|11|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_368.wav|105|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_164.wav|105|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_394.wav|91|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_161.wav|23|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_394.wav|87|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_371.wav|93|That would help.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_304.wav|49|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_411.wav|89|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_236.wav|34|Anything can happen - at any moment.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_200.wav|62|Hear what they have to say.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_181.wav|11|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_145.wav|89|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_306.wav|2|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_072.wav|34|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_198.wav|15|Do what you want to do.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_271.wav|14|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_382.wav|78|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_209.wav|75|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_358.wav|93|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_237.wav|75|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_283.wav|46|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_280.wav|2|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_112.wav|52|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_081.wav|68|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_099.wav|69|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_135.wav|99|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_065.wav|0|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_207.wav|82|Progress is being made but it is slow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_334.wav|37|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_398.wav|75|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_035.wav|38|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_207.wav|23|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_380.wav|25|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_090.wav|45|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_244.wav|87|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_013.wav|13|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_141.wav|78|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_363.wav|8|An alternative must be offered.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_190.wav|21|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_113.wav|4|Don't get me wrong.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_468.wav|14|That should get their attention.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_225.wav|5|But she was.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_162.wav|51|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_128.wav|77|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_354.wav|8|There is a good example in this city.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_282.wav|36|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_080.wav|86|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_361.wav|26|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_046.wav|45|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_145.wav|9|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_276.wav|8|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_139.wav|76|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_048.wav|30|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_045.wav|47|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_401.wav|70|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_143.wav|52|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_337.wav|31|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_285.wav|106|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_374.wav|10|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_262.wav|54|I don't think it could be clearer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_126.wav|15|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_091.wav|5|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_218.wav|77|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_340.wav|63|I didn't have the reply.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_410.wav|64|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_164.wav|82|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_165.wav|29|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_373.wav|35|It's going to be fun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_049.wav|43|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_103.wav|54|It is understood they saw one body.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_341.wav|56|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_104.wav|39|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_184.wav|32|Miller was every bit as happy.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_394.wav|41|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_247.wav|29|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_320.wav|80|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_148.wav|25|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_042.wav|30|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_028.wav|21|I was very, very pleased with our display.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_028.wav|59|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_281.wav|86|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_044.wav|5|We will push.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_237.wav|85|Then it was changed without notice.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_244.wav|92|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_259.wav|16|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_130.wav|52|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_145.wav|92|He's working hard on that right now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_146.wav|13|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_346.wav|95|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_356.wav|2|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_147.wav|1|He changed my life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_202.wav|60|I'm really looking forward to that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_099.wav|50|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_162.wav|44|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_357.wav|14|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_204.wav|0|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_042.wav|91|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_039.wav|1|Or so she thought.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_072.wav|6|Thirty people have applied for his job!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_105.wav|58|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_115.wav|55|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_095.wav|62|It will be a challenging film.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_070.wav|33|those who are preparing to give up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_172.wav|42|I'm not talking about his career.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_144.wav|27|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_118.wav|76|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_022.wav|60|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_238.wav|22|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_168.wav|39|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_072.wav|64|The jury is still out on this one.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_124.wav|68|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_310.wav|100|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_255.wav|78|A lot has been written.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_036.wav|11|I was contacted this morning.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_311.wav|18|The first time it was rejected.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_387.wav|77|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_076.wav|10|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_181.wav|58|You see - this business is a good one.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_296.wav|85|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_359.wav|66|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_262.wav|50|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_053.wav|49|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_155.wav|52|Time may already have run out for this option.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_260.wav|46|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_104.wav|91|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_067.wav|104|I fell in love with it right away.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_277.wav|87|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_018.wav|50|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_074.wav|57|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_003.wav|53|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_102.wav|34|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_074.wav|79|They said there was nothing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_252.wav|96|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_308.wav|47|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_007.wav|6|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_315.wav|31|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_108.wav|69|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_077.wav|59|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_002.wav|47|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_031.wav|42|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_326.wav|106|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_257.wav|93|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_128.wav|2|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_002.wav|71|"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  "
DUMMY2/p297/p297_334.wav|42|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_121.wav|82|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_016.wav|10|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_406.wav|50|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_250.wav|105|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_319.wav|32|McNaughton was not so sure.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_089.wav|18|She had to learn a new discipline.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_389.wav|34|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_348.wav|25|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_332.wav|87|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_209.wav|18|Everything in the symphony is there.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_176.wav|29|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_334.wav|1|What are you waiting for?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_396.wav|7|That is a crazy situation.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_077.wav|60|I have to hand it to the bank.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_375.wav|65|We have a high quality product.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_192.wav|27|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_164.wav|37|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_164.wav|66|It was then into overtime.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_339.wav|103|I'll take the blame for that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_244.wav|88|It was a surprising decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_125.wav|64|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_234.wav|82|That is not an easy thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_074.wav|11|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_125.wav|92|The look on his face was something special.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_293.wav|60|I have never been unemployed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_066.wav|93|They are real.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_282.wav|17|I'd never heard him in person before.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_144.wav|35|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_337.wav|15|It was quite an ordeal for them.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_019.wav|64|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_194.wav|12|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_075.wav|25|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_223.wav|76|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_010.wav|16|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_007.wav|30|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_343.wav|49|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_015.wav|96|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_243.wav|62|That's where it all started.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_342.wav|66|We are very nearly there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_175.wav|32|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_349.wav|6|Nobody was able to escape.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_251.wav|34|Maybe they will show it next year.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_178.wav|9|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_321.wav|98|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_199.wav|37|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_038.wav|11|It's not just a challenge for us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_481.wav|24|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_213.wav|49|You saw the pain he was in.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_351.wav|75|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_135.wav|41|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_228.wav|32|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_111.wav|49|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_116.wav|37|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_182.wav|8|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_381.wav|42|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_297.wav|25|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_163.wav|82|IT takes the biscuit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_225.wav|96|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_205.wav|53|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_126.wav|39|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_307.wav|5|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_370.wav|22|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_325.wav|0|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_071.wav|48|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_005.wav|37|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_028.wav|34|Now it is much easier.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_419.wav|22|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_108.wav|73|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_095.wav|50|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_358.wav|84|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_277.wav|95|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_276.wav|49|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_049.wav|82|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_039.wav|85|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_292.wav|51|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_281.wav|28|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_363.wav|34|I think she is supreme.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_009.wav|103|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_269.wav|66|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_028.wav|102|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_075.wav|70|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_110.wav|86|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_113.wav|99|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_107.wav|87|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_421.wav|37|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_352.wav|3|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_431.wav|36|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_235.wav|70|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_329.wav|106|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_258.wav|58|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_309.wav|102|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_389.wav|48|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_097.wav|10|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_314.wav|36|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_428.wav|106|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_209.wav|51|You saw the football.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_445.wav|89|The children are fine.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_214.wav|20|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_290.wav|5|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_299.wav|31|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_265.wav|27|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_071.wav|8|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_001.wav|24|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_251.wav|66|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_085.wav|83|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_145.wav|80|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_212.wav|107|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_126.wav|86|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_021.wav|22|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_072.wav|88|There is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_326.wav|91|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_314.wav|106|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_195.wav|4|They seem to turn up for them.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_162.wav|75|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_223.wav|84|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_273.wav|79|My husband was fighting for his life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_225.wav|39|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_269.wav|47|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_183.wav|60|You have to wait.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_011.wav|48|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_259.wav|38|I am getting long in the tooth.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_214.wav|98|I have friends in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_003.wav|79|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_361.wav|27|And he laughs.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_120.wav|52|It is the right package for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_331.wav|36|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_287.wav|15|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_369.wav|4|We have some concerns.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_097.wav|27|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_071.wav|56|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_377.wav|17|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_111.wav|24|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_348.wav|57|Everyone was in tears.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_073.wav|39|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_076.wav|71|"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_107.wav|88|We are not leaving the area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_201.wav|50|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_119.wav|91|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_300.wav|69|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_165.wav|75|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_383.wav|32|It was like a weekly wage.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_308.wav|54|It worked, up to a point.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_305.wav|13|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_001.wav|100|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_127.wav|102|I went straight to the toilet.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_320.wav|70|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_214.wav|50|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p339/p339_304.wav|18|He had planned to sell it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_158.wav|51|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_103.wav|63|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_080.wav|13|That was him under pressure.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_151.wav|24|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_041.wav|1|This advice was accepted by ministers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_241.wav|79|He was also very happy to listen.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_207.wav|93|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_073.wav|15|I am going to win the next two.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_334.wav|76|She has nothing to say to journalists.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_388.wav|46|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_199.wav|100|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_174.wav|16|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_040.wav|83|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_350.wav|24|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_075.wav|23|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_300.wav|41|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_060.wav|66|I think it is a sensible change.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_158.wav|59|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_045.wav|66|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_087.wav|5|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_384.wav|94|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_032.wav|6|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_011.wav|107|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_474.wav|100|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_236.wav|100|They have not been in touch with the club.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_391.wav|63|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_323.wav|62|That will be the case on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_274.wav|15|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_232.wav|100|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_010.wav|74|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_347.wav|6|Gritty he did not want.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_345.wav|25|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_022.wav|72|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_159.wav|32|Full back was a bit of the unknown.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_232.wav|52|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_025.wav|86|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_250.wav|81|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_323.wav|28|I don't want to change anything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_406.wav|25|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_085.wav|57|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_096.wav|2|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_060.wav|34|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_412.wav|46|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_267.wav|98|Not that it is unique.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_178.wav|28|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_235.wav|15|He is advised that he has done so.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_212.wav|9|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_108.wav|65|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_403.wav|98|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_351.wav|55|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_312.wav|63|Our season is not finished.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_456.wav|7|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_315.wav|2|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_076.wav|90|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_181.wav|24|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_303.wav|41|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_027.wav|80|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_406.wav|62|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_311.wav|87|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_356.wav|48|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_246.wav|13|It starts to get you down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_350.wav|7|The pound has also suffered.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_211.wav|27|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_424.wav|42|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_358.wav|17|This is the lowest of the low.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_204.wav|100|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_374.wav|66|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_346.wav|46|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_077.wav|106|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_237.wav|34|He predicted the contest would be very close.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_189.wav|11|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_198.wav|69|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_090.wav|14|Petrol prices were widely blamed.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_249.wav|6|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_128.wav|8|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_395.wav|15|I never got anything out of it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_050.wav|21|It is a beautiful country.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_128.wav|107|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_046.wav|56|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_312.wav|103|But both were involved with other matters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_368.wav|42|It has proved a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_044.wav|30|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_058.wav|44|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_091.wav|99|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_235.wav|71|"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_075.wav|46|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_331.wav|62|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_117.wav|78|This is a sea change in approach.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_359.wav|35|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_395.wav|35|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_201.wav|96|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_289.wav|94|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_071.wav|19|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_303.wav|80|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_401.wav|10|They know it'll be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_446.wav|50|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_123.wav|17|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_121.wav|26|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_145.wav|21|We are not going to get carried away.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_325.wav|63|They can go to no other method of fishing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_265.wav|69|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_308.wav|67|It's just not funny !
DUMMY2/p295/p295_233.wav|92|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_364.wav|94|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_060.wav|48|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_250.wav|10|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_289.wav|65|You have made your point.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_140.wav|104|It was a hugely popular decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_349.wav|103|That is absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_117.wav|68|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_444.wav|65|The company was set up six years ago.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_036.wav|6|It certainly is cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_075.wav|51|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_254.wav|36|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_371.wav|22|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_010.wav|8|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_179.wav|89|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_329.wav|93|We do the same.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_178.wav|24|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_112.wav|5|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_298.wav|40|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_199.wav|71|"The sisters also became the top two players in the world."
DUMMY2/p250/p250_199.wav|24|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_146.wav|58|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_076.wav|21|We are at the crossroads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_186.wav|55|Art can challenge our value system.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_057.wav|100|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_410.wav|48|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_120.wav|34|We have a high quality product.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_254.wav|89|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_145.wav|87|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_179.wav|101|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_107.wav|21|I am not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_067.wav|56|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_387.wav|63|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_018.wav|5|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_035.wav|2|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_066.wav|44|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_109.wav|33|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_054.wav|69|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_072.wav|29|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_032.wav|20|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_186.wav|1|I think it'll be a great occasion.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_304.wav|53|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_355.wav|53|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_191.wav|64|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_019.wav|9|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_392.wav|38|He would take up the bike.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_231.wav|51|She was a delightful person.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_143.wav|40|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_328.wav|57|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_071.wav|97|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_400.wav|20|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_084.wav|87|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_236.wav|97|Michael, he is running!
DUMMY2/p225/p225_295.wav|101|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_069.wav|100|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_256.wav|72|But experts have disputed that statistic.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_039.wav|74|It is a recipe for success.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_025.wav|12|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_306.wav|63|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_327.wav|45|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_327.wav|47|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_055.wav|15|He is one of them.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_303.wav|90|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_074.wav|1|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_326.wav|107|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_132.wav|88|He just attracted people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_101.wav|102|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_064.wav|89|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_130.wav|51|It's very tragic and traumatic.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_260.wav|20|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_021.wav|89|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_339.wav|26|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_009.wav|80|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_200.wav|30|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_277.wav|54|They married in August last year.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_160.wav|31|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_287.wav|25|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_359.wav|75|Scotland is the home of golf.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_346.wav|13|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_352.wav|32|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_349.wav|97|There was no need for such a hostel.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_072.wav|50|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_466.wav|65|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_326.wav|85|He was happy with his form.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_221.wav|104|The six others were injured.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_237.wav|20|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_027.wav|56|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_339.wav|43|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_265.wav|101|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_227.wav|30|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_297.wav|72|What will they called?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_299.wav|97|Some reports said they had been killed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_391.wav|22|I had no qualms about it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_197.wav|78|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_062.wav|55|For a decade she was proved right.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_395.wav|68|I am just looking to God.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_088.wav|54|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_246.wav|16|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_297.wav|26|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_286.wav|1|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_160.wav|68|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_071.wav|6|This is a judgment issue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_349.wav|81|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_157.wav|94|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_379.wav|98|It may be the first of many.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_320.wav|23|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_090.wav|46|It is a hangover effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_143.wav|39|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_397.wav|32|It's never great to finish second.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_232.wav|63|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_010.wav|19|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_095.wav|11|That, though, is not true.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_334.wav|84|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_104.wav|67|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_279.wav|92|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_114.wav|81|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_075.wav|44|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_411.wav|50|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_358.wav|28|Labour is providing none of these.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_190.wav|73|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_149.wav|98|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_187.wav|69|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_241.wav|35|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_143.wav|77|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_332.wav|103|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_350.wav|86|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_379.wav|70|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_075.wav|56|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_064.wav|84|It was an amazing result.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_241.wav|11|It's always somebody else's.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_262.wav|55|So we kept them waiting.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_029.wav|27|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_193.wav|92|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_134.wav|53|There is no future in rock music.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_296.wav|104|It just would not work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_168.wav|31|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_422.wav|107|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_167.wav|93|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_155.wav|21|They've been wonderful to me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_151.wav|71|"The weaknesses are few."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_091.wav|92|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_268.wav|51|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_279.wav|42|Part of England, is not?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_310.wav|2|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_157.wav|15|And he still is.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_264.wav|10|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_423.wav|103|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_070.wav|8|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_117.wav|28|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_257.wav|19|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_329.wav|56|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_051.wav|78|In my view, it has to be done.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_386.wav|15|It's a good offer by any standards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_173.wav|95|Today I had no failures in my team.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_364.wav|29|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_195.wav|105|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_215.wav|74|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_145.wav|29|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_139.wav|29|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_052.wav|63|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_325.wav|100|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_369.wav|7|They promised to fight the plans.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_140.wav|8|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_147.wav|71|"He will emerge as a world leader."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_410.wav|20|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_205.wav|60|We didn't, and it worked for us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_044.wav|89|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_355.wav|4|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_214.wav|106|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_278.wav|42|We've always had a very positive attitude.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_346.wav|67|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_170.wav|49|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_388.wav|87|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_032.wav|47|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_042.wav|87|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_141.wav|17|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_115.wav|84|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_094.wav|102|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_308.wav|15|We all make mistakes.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_227.wav|6|They know nothing about the sport.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_064.wav|92|It is, after all, a very funny play.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_391.wav|106|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_219.wav|71|"It is a gamble."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_394.wav|98|There were few surprises.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_034.wav|96|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_386.wav|33|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_104.wav|60|The call was ignored.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_148.wav|33|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_052.wav|0|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_228.wav|68|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_323.wav|36|I can see their argument.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_357.wav|53|It is the only natural British site on the list.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_043.wav|11|I still hope to go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_090.wav|33|This is already happening.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_116.wav|25|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_332.wav|89|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_186.wav|96|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_137.wav|66|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_166.wav|63|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_402.wav|55|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_165.wav|52|But the game is still wide open.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_214.wav|26|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_054.wav|83|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_371.wav|50|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_015.wav|13|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_422.wav|50|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_357.wav|27|That would help.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_032.wav|27|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_019.wav|8|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_164.wav|36|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_183.wav|2|Many innocent people will die.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_322.wav|73|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_076.wav|25|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_240.wav|52|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_302.wav|77|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_228.wav|18|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_138.wav|91|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_089.wav|2|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_400.wav|25|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_085.wav|85|It is, after all, a very funny play.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_207.wav|8|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_173.wav|46|I never found my rhythm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_348.wav|21|No one can say that about me.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_372.wav|79|It is very funny.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_014.wav|97|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_030.wav|51|I believe in the Church.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_012.wav|34|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_006.wav|66|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_258.wav|41|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_055.wav|45|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_330.wav|106|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_431.wav|39|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_081.wav|19|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_276.wav|39|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_120.wav|93|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_348.wav|28|I can't see him reversing that.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_085.wav|100|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_393.wav|96|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_266.wav|10|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_139.wav|31|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_400.wav|74|They were not defeated.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_297.wav|102|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_191.wav|46|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_375.wav|41|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_218.wav|34|The process itself has taken over.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_014.wav|25|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_288.wav|68|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_314.wav|28|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_333.wav|60|Pakistan denied the report.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_111.wav|51|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_121.wav|49|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_292.wav|68|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_358.wav|6|But it is a fact.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_294.wav|53|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_008.wav|58|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_293.wav|59|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_258.wav|2|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_187.wav|55|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_222.wav|48|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_148.wav|83|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_185.wav|90|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_010.wav|61|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_114.wav|53|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_244.wav|58|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_236.wav|28|Seems a sensible compromise.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_379.wav|106|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_193.wav|66|It has to be a long-term commitment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_345.wav|81|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_362.wav|54|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_004.wav|106|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_151.wav|35|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_314.wav|68|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_355.wav|24|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_179.wav|41|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_152.wav|24|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_407.wav|62|There is no easy answer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_488.wav|75|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_275.wav|90|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_240.wav|102|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_322.wav|39|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_192.wav|97|He said that this is beautiful.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_213.wav|70|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_142.wav|58|Such a city does not exist.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_336.wav|87|The only problem was the greens.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_299.wav|55|He followed the Italian route.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_210.wav|73|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_379.wav|54|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_262.wav|22|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_120.wav|95|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_173.wav|54|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_045.wav|5|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_129.wav|57|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_081.wav|15|I have to accept that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_043.wav|78|Something has to be put in place.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_359.wav|45|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_159.wav|30|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_430.wav|24|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_241.wav|81|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_020.wav|67|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_274.wav|45|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_243.wav|105|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_117.wav|67|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_136.wav|36|People come from all round the world to see it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_348.wav|55|That was our last chance to do something.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_277.wav|46|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_338.wav|99|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_309.wav|49|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_076.wav|40|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_369.wav|29|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_299.wav|37|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_286.wav|29|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_354.wav|21|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_154.wav|61|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_101.wav|107|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_044.wav|64|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_196.wav|36|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_083.wav|17|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_197.wav|71|"The service from the other players was super."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_062.wav|105|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_201.wav|74|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_129.wav|48|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_182.wav|24|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_363.wav|97|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_166.wav|96|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_203.wav|79|Everyone knew the family.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_060.wav|22|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_363.wav|60|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_324.wav|80|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_264.wav|34|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_043.wav|39|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_180.wav|15|This is a fine appointment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_109.wav|65|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_091.wav|37|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_333.wav|35|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_058.wav|69|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_457.wav|48|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_226.wav|88|It hasn't worked out that way.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_295.wav|43|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_280.wav|72|That used to be another thing of mine.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_091.wav|8|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_050.wav|16|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_365.wav|64|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_332.wav|50|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_240.wav|12|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_371.wav|37|We will likely look for new investors.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_055.wav|34|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_087.wav|97|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_217.wav|104|It's not a question of talking.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_085.wav|105|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_405.wav|50|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_446.wav|24|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_116.wav|95|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_461.wav|106|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_160.wav|73|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_273.wav|59|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_204.wav|10|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_263.wav|57|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_213.wav|43|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_206.wav|96|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_111.wav|93|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_006.wav|86|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_129.wav|58|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_023.wav|104|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_117.wav|30|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_191.wav|36|I have accepted the challenge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_268.wav|58|She is a great talent.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_022.wav|69|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_084.wav|94|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_017.wav|69|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_315.wav|20|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_215.wav|1|It had to be more flexible.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_085.wav|78|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_176.wav|19|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_025.wav|89|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_173.wav|80|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_236.wav|72|You can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_286.wav|58|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_289.wav|68|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_114.wav|23|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_074.wav|6|We are not commenting at the moment.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_270.wav|25|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_104.wav|97|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_114.wav|92|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_332.wav|15|It is quite hard to track.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_227.wav|95|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_299.wav|107|I really don't understand what is happening.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_064.wav|98|The second is freedom.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_361.wav|47|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_180.wav|89|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_116.wav|19|We act because we must.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_205.wav|83|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_153.wav|22|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_265.wav|92|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_338.wav|69|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_145.wav|73|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_108.wav|88|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_245.wav|25|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_084.wav|14|The party is up for it.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_426.wav|50|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_169.wav|23|I just want to enjoy myself.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_344.wav|53|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_222.wav|66|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_118.wav|100|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_085.wav|26|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_246.wav|94|I know I'm in a very special position.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_147.wav|3|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_231.wav|10|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_179.wav|35|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_104.wav|107|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_112.wav|60|She was close to suicide at one stage.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_261.wav|78|But it was a loss.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_074.wav|99|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_238.wav|92|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_321.wav|9|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_149.wav|33|They will be ready.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_025.wav|22|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_194.wav|39|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_337.wav|35|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_006.wav|9|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_367.wav|47|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_212.wav|59|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_202.wav|33|Ownership was the game.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_262.wav|3|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_292.wav|93|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_069.wav|18|Services are being expanded, too.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_135.wav|77|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_206.wav|14|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_217.wav|34|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_078.wav|102|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_050.wav|35|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_216.wav|76|We're still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_100.wav|79|What has changed since then?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_364.wav|52|Both players gave so much to the side.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_196.wav|9|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_165.wav|56|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_044.wav|22|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_129.wav|27|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_212.wav|86|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_230.wav|36|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_362.wav|55|He was a great human being.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_063.wav|62|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_199.wav|76|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_127.wav|64|It was a disaster.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_123.wav|93|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_293.wav|74|The Dream is as hard as they come.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_127.wav|28|I've beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_345.wav|28|I can't speak for him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_147.wav|56|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_176.wav|105|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_259.wav|27|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_206.wav|23|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_088.wav|22|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_014.wav|69|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_117.wav|90|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_345.wav|52|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_033.wav|32|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_244.wav|1|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_072.wav|54|How do you resurrect a dying town?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_178.wav|29|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_373.wav|98|Further expansion is possible.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_353.wav|45|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_377.wav|2|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_042.wav|81|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_347.wav|36|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_243.wav|16|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_208.wav|93|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_453.wav|7|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_222.wav|70|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_181.wav|43|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_381.wav|37|It was cynical and callous.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_324.wav|96|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_234.wav|81|The whole thing will be great.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_192.wav|33|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_356.wav|100|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_260.wav|58|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_423.wav|39|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_456.wav|48|Now it has doubled in size.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_244.wav|93|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_229.wav|66|I'm not saying he is finished.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_118.wav|37|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_288.wav|28|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_269.wav|68|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_288.wav|12|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_369.wav|41|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_029.wav|77|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_323.wav|35|The group is not paying a dividend.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_421.wav|51|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_135.wav|83|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_011.wav|88|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_391.wav|28|My father had been unwell for many years.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_143.wav|20|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_020.wav|23|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_144.wav|19|They played it like a cup final.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_177.wav|32|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_194.wav|11|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_127.wav|24|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_412.wav|92|That can happen so easily.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_267.wav|38|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_084.wav|60|His musicals were very much of their time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_041.wav|45|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_002.wav|50|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_150.wav|76|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_035.wav|21|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_220.wav|39|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_310.wav|70|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_328.wav|16|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_139.wav|74|Weather conditions were good, he added.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_323.wav|68|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_062.wav|53|The referee is there to decide these things.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_334.wav|54|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_186.wav|9|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_232.wav|90|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_054.wav|94|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_159.wav|72|This is not a Scottish problem.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_106.wav|93|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_190.wav|17|The show is small but perfectly formed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_273.wav|0|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_146.wav|15|Who is going to pay their wages?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_345.wav|82|But something has been lost in the translation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_304.wav|78|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_218.wav|2|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_322.wav|37|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_068.wav|82|We were caught out.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_241.wav|10|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_325.wav|33|Seven people were already in custody in France.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_316.wav|73|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_171.wav|19|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_171.wav|69|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_024.wav|22|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_382.wav|14|There is no deal as yet.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_035.wav|56|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_342.wav|78|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_223.wav|104|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_328.wav|95|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_325.wav|89|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_239.wav|33|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_404.wav|15|That's a good sign.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_285.wav|85|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_193.wav|55|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_236.wav|35|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_076.wav|104|She now lives in London.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_022.wav|5|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_448.wav|14|There were no formal announcements.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_303.wav|98|It is three years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_269.wav|78|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_228.wav|92|Not so, it transpires.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_324.wav|81|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_093.wav|39|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_134.wav|107|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_112.wav|15|Of course, it is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_114.wav|39|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_200.wav|107|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_278.wav|94|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_355.wav|60|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_273.wav|9|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_023.wav|23|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_064.wav|82|There will be no threat to the game.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_119.wav|63|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_266.wav|30|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_393.wav|52|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_196.wav|78|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_069.wav|8|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_200.wav|6|It was a horrible moment.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_255.wav|52|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_402.wav|40|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_318.wav|7|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_267.wav|79|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_163.wav|93|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_109.wav|71|"But the fans deserve to know!"
DUMMY2/p268/p268_358.wav|87|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_262.wav|36|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_349.wav|19|It has been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_356.wav|51|We don't want to push him.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_411.wav|15|We want everyone to have a good time.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_413.wav|40|I am extremely cautious.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_140.wav|75|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_391.wav|32|It runs until the beginning of June.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_082.wav|29|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_030.wav|107|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_424.wav|56|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_366.wav|26|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_188.wav|77|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_020.wav|103|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_309.wav|72|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_046.wav|76|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_345.wav|16|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_206.wav|27|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_336.wav|45|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_331.wav|96|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_084.wav|57|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_341.wav|69|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_113.wav|100|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_354.wav|78|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_037.wav|100|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_051.wav|72|But they also came with a downside.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_311.wav|42|Bob Dylan's getting old.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_408.wav|22|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_109.wav|53|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_030.wav|69|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_010.wav|65|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p284/p284_131.wav|16|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_336.wav|92|This time, however, may have been different.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_319.wav|35|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_312.wav|74|But it is historic.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_084.wav|58|But there was a shift.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_042.wav|24|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_400.wav|52|There were no hard words between us.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_221.wav|94|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_338.wav|62|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_301.wav|39|So the Government will be damaged.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_159.wav|68|The inquiry had been going on for months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_153.wav|3|That is the nature of the game.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_366.wav|94|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_018.wav|107|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_221.wav|103|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_274.wav|53|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_468.wav|50|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_350.wav|89|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_089.wav|54|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_341.wav|28|It would be a massive boost for them.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_327.wav|65|They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_228.wav|70|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_281.wav|30|We have taken steps to rectify it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_372.wav|40|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_237.wav|73|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_181.wav|29|I think it's a good sign.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_302.wav|89|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_358.wav|92|He was elected as a councillor last year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_328.wav|106|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_053.wav|5|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_182.wav|2|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_382.wav|69|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_032.wav|62|We have a high quality product.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_057.wav|59|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_339.wav|66|They told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_346.wav|92|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_104.wav|14|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_127.wav|97|Hear what they have to say.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_273.wav|5|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_145.wav|15|The choice is simple.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_056.wav|74|Where is the money coming from?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_070.wav|77|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_260.wav|29|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_373.wav|39|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_056.wav|71|"Next league matches Celtic."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_055.wav|22|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_380.wav|23|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_228.wav|54|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_221.wav|78|It was important to win today.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_081.wav|53|I do not attempt to answer that.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_153.wav|55|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_143.wav|21|He had finally had enough.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_230.wav|30|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_178.wav|90|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_277.wav|67|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_177.wav|9|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_291.wav|79|I will never forget that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_414.wav|48|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_001.wav|20|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_076.wav|44|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_467.wav|39|Tickets will be at a premium.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_160.wav|77|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_170.wav|98|These days will be back.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_214.wav|73|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_068.wav|34|We were beaten by the better team today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_075.wav|14|I was very pleased with them today, though.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_271.wav|19|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_049.wav|19|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_305.wav|8|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_324.wav|49|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_012.wav|42|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_004.wav|24|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_020.wav|17|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_252.wav|99|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_181.wav|78|I was always in control.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_222.wav|35|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_466.wav|24|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_414.wav|65|I was the sheep.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_052.wav|23|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_054.wav|8|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_106.wav|12|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_324.wav|13|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_402.wav|56|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_176.wav|2|My players are special.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_236.wav|8|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_178.wav|83|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_010.wav|105|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_233.wav|40|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_118.wav|67|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_129.wav|6|Look at the turn-out.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_154.wav|63|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_321.wav|49|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_216.wav|107|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_077.wav|26|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_348.wav|31|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_325.wav|27|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_025.wav|20|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_384.wav|67|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_319.wav|67|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_179.wav|0|The European Union is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_024.wav|70|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_104.wav|24|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_027.wav|68|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_145.wav|95|We are entirely happy with Russell.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_384.wav|69|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_041.wav|2|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_320.wav|1|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_370.wav|34|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_095.wav|63|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_113.wav|95|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_208.wav|94|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_262.wav|64|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_390.wav|11|We are all very pleased.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_246.wav|71|"I watched a game."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_141.wav|100|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_018.wav|57|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_363.wav|19|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_124.wav|23|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_258.wav|50|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_238.wav|10|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_241.wav|80|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_191.wav|66|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_007.wav|53|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_284.wav|73|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_281.wav|31|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_116.wav|17|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_001.wav|49|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_211.wav|28|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_414.wav|38|We are here for the long term.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_382.wav|4|And the winners are.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_398.wav|58|She will just have wanted her baby.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_199.wav|64|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_380.wav|89|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_243.wav|19|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_130.wav|70|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_262.wav|58|Also, he was flawed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_328.wav|65|He did not say that.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_145.wav|82|His name has not been released.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_004.wav|61|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_281.wav|13|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_124.wav|24|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_049.wav|96|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_263.wav|73|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_366.wav|36|There will be no final dividend.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_063.wav|80|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_292.wav|30|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_180.wav|23|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_013.wav|61|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_227.wav|87|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_293.wav|7|I'd never run for them.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_018.wav|86|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_121.wav|98|Why does it come out now?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_196.wav|0|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_099.wav|77|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_184.wav|25|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_188.wav|73|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_238.wav|58|We should be trying to keep him in.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_113.wav|15|I've never felt affection for Emu.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_388.wav|76|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_344.wav|51|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_161.wav|19|I can make one further announcement.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_338.wav|38|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_288.wav|1|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_210.wav|59|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_343.wav|93|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_396.wav|40|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_154.wav|43|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_051.wav|43|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_219.wav|4|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_398.wav|10|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_277.wav|28|It will not be today, though.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_184.wav|54|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_125.wav|15|Both are national treasures.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_276.wav|70|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_159.wav|20|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_345.wav|74|When will this change?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_051.wav|29|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_317.wav|37|Here the picture is broadly stable.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_325.wav|75|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_116.wav|51|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_071.wav|72|I do not believe they are.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_206.wav|45|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_430.wav|89|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_175.wav|54|I got on very well with Allan.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_328.wav|40|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_354.wav|67|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_080.wav|23|Sometimes they come off.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_119.wav|17|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_008.wav|55|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_193.wav|74|I can't say anything.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_288.wav|30|They came into collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_291.wav|70|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_354.wav|95|My life is exactly the same.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_019.wav|23|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_253.wav|27|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_078.wav|50|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_017.wav|72|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_016.wav|97|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_154.wav|22|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_373.wav|17|There was support from across the board.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_152.wav|100|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_047.wav|66|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_361.wav|67|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_171.wav|99|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_362.wav|47|That would help.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_270.wav|42|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_298.wav|33|It is a very worrying report.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_142.wav|82|Scotland has lost a great man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_301.wav|13|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_321.wav|51|Hitches can be expected.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_042.wav|65|It is a complex deal.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_308.wav|1|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_093.wav|40|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_098.wav|37|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_103.wav|104|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_069.wav|94|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_319.wav|100|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_368.wav|39|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_339.wav|36|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_218.wav|50|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_333.wav|18|The problem is fairly serious.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_093.wav|43|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_174.wav|103|She had experience of the wildest places.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_468.wav|48|The money is within the total allocation.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_153.wav|33|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_207.wav|71|"I began to pray."
DUMMY2/p330/p330_011.wav|1|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_321.wav|7|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_016.wav|44|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_074.wav|46|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_355.wav|15|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_058.wav|1|I think they should have more respect.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_013.wav|56|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_286.wav|3|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_114.wav|43|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_115.wav|0|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_023.wav|14|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p260/p260_115.wav|81|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_293.wav|72|She says she has grown up.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_064.wav|107|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_191.wav|92|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_069.wav|105|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_227.wav|53|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_061.wav|59|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_024.wav|0|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_077.wav|40|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_098.wav|44|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_021.wav|62|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_328.wav|53|He is not exactly a pretty child.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_185.wav|68|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_355.wav|100|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_287.wav|76|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_298.wav|3|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_227.wav|27|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_297.wav|63|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_378.wav|62|We are very nearly there.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_271.wav|60|That was six years ago.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_093.wav|76|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_350.wav|20|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_253.wav|96|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_315.wav|44|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_083.wav|68|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_285.wav|38|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_171.wav|68|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_153.wav|41|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_026.wav|20|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_213.wav|36|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_137.wav|17|People can describe a moment in their life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_053.wav|101|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_177.wav|78|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_129.wav|29|And I have some advice for my old friend.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_346.wav|19|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_252.wav|2|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_072.wav|8|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_103.wav|100|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_248.wav|61|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_243.wav|66|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_209.wav|31|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_009.wav|87|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_223.wav|59|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_127.wav|36|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_088.wav|40|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_341.wav|48|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_201.wav|80|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_345.wav|12|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_345.wav|86|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_170.wav|39|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_279.wav|3|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_064.wav|44|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_298.wav|92|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_230.wav|0|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_228.wav|2|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_284.wav|6|It was quite a sight.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_035.wav|60|He would not have to explain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_104.wav|30|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_460.wav|39|It has been a waste of time.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_338.wav|1|It's annoying in a way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_159.wav|29|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_160.wav|40|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_235.wav|83|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_150.wav|48|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p269/p269_187.wav|94|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_223.wav|5|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_103.wav|65|The referee had been right.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_012.wav|106|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_381.wav|68|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_194.wav|28|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_343.wav|8|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_285.wav|5|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_156.wav|105|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_411.wav|103|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_012.wav|16|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_328.wav|1|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_169.wav|86|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_289.wav|46|My wife is totally behind me on this.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_161.wav|12|You should be there with six different characters.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_241.wav|41|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_315.wav|58|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_251.wav|30|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_317.wav|22|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_120.wav|12|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_039.wav|23|It's a sensible management decision.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_132.wav|8|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_213.wav|100|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_253.wav|30|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_026.wav|75|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_236.wav|86|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_280.wav|23|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_198.wav|33|He invented the language.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_122.wav|39|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_320.wav|42|There are different cultures in different departments.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_188.wav|100|That is a waste of energy.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_273.wav|41|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_411.wav|36|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_270.wav|64|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_022.wav|55|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_178.wav|33|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_170.wav|19|There is a simmering anger out there.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_238.wav|95|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_217.wav|41|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_346.wav|23|The attitude and commitment was decent.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_480.wav|65|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_006.wav|100|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_052.wav|76|What were they?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_045.wav|22|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_255.wav|2|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_150.wav|83|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_008.wav|80|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_179.wav|11|We have got away with it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_344.wav|54|So there's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_252.wav|4|He has to pull back from the brink.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_243.wav|100|It is the loss of my name.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_438.wav|27|Admission is free.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_236.wav|23|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_138.wav|59|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_059.wav|38|It was totally my fault.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_096.wav|26|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_298.wav|20|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_030.wav|13|I thought the game was very poor.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_102.wav|96|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_103.wav|91|I am very sorry to be here.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_163.wav|107|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_050.wav|92|He declined to give further details.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_347.wav|63|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_179.wav|16|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_069.wav|58|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_335.wav|102|I believe he can do a better job.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_232.wav|76|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_139.wav|66|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_369.wav|49|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_227.wav|14|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_177.wav|102|It shows that we are civilised society.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_244.wav|11|This was not a contest.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_306.wav|44|Some have other commitments.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_007.wav|60|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_047.wav|88|We must not give in to bastards.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_032.wav|85|This is not a war on terror.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_245.wav|107|Mr Miller is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_306.wav|1|I do not want to wait until May.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_104.wav|75|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_360.wav|94|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_040.wav|89|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_326.wav|47|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_223.wav|8|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_113.wav|74|The film is on a tightrope.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_220.wav|63|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_336.wav|102|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_098.wav|16|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_195.wav|63|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_174.wav|27|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_198.wav|4|It is that sort of film.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_227.wav|57|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_365.wav|47|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_193.wav|87|In addition, margins have been maintained.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_351.wav|43|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_290.wav|8|It involved the same people.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_134.wav|41|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_322.wav|0|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_165.wav|104|There was no change in the strategy.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_040.wav|107|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_321.wav|89|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_377.wav|19|She is currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_014.wav|10|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_171.wav|11|It is not for me, though.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_432.wav|24|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_118.wav|52|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_241.wav|45|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_063.wav|56|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_449.wav|95|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_115.wav|72|Justice was not seen today.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_068.wav|87|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_241.wav|28|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_110.wav|12|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_213.wav|53|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_069.wav|16|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_222.wav|21|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_226.wav|14|The process will start tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_141.wav|98|We need to be more specific.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_055.wav|59|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_158.wav|36|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_198.wav|60|Stardom is a funny thing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_017.wav|100|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_082.wav|26|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_198.wav|103|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_059.wav|34|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_108.wav|11|Lester was like that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_351.wav|42|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_206.wav|98|Do they play for the money?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_085.wav|4|He added, We are not prepared for war.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_239.wav|78|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_027.wav|0|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_052.wav|86|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_159.wav|89|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_190.wav|98|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_224.wav|82|But this is just the start.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_317.wav|47|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_211.wav|67|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_065.wav|86|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_250.wav|63|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_086.wav|79|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_020.wav|55|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_280.wav|46|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_342.wav|20|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_122.wav|19|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_032.wav|48|That's all I was trying to do today.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_122.wav|16|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_231.wav|34|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_438.wav|48|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_063.wav|39|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_346.wav|56|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_249.wav|62|These will finally be corrected by next week.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_225.wav|79|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_176.wav|74|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_302.wav|47|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_340.wav|37|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_070.wav|32|What do we do ?)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_024.wav|36|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_032.wav|1|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_075.wav|53|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_273.wav|100|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_263.wav|50|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_312.wav|6|His remit is specific.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_263.wav|21|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_078.wav|12|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_337.wav|20|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_137.wav|100|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_169.wav|85|Consumers will also benefit.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_160.wav|87|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_079.wav|96|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_017.wav|80|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_121.wav|46|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_087.wav|62|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_294.wav|13|That will be the key to success.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_014.wav|61|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_359.wav|57|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_093.wav|31|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_328.wav|107|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_014.wav|95|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_060.wav|72|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_240.wav|107|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_074.wav|52|But two groups refused to sign up.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_197.wav|56|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_333.wav|99|I said that I had been raped.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_285.wav|97|He also has a house in Italy.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_114.wav|82|Let's get it on.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_050.wav|28|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_299.wav|11|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_154.wav|19|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_140.wav|3|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_367.wav|63|I think we'll just keep it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_125.wav|95|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_282.wav|98|I watch the other visitors.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_383.wav|55|I got dropped for that game.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_380.wav|67|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_329.wav|87|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_203.wav|11|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_484.wav|65|That is surely worth a try.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_367.wav|72|It was a discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_088.wav|97|We will see how he is after treatment.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_322.wav|79|There was nowhere for him to go.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_375.wav|18|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_004.wav|31|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_277.wav|17|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_187.wav|48|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_124.wav|62|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_018.wav|30|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_338.wav|2|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_310.wav|38|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_117.wav|4|They are all Arabs.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_079.wav|18|What we were doing.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_102.wav|46|I'm looking forward to that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_080.wav|104|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_006.wav|38|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_350.wav|102|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_239.wav|0|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_346.wav|26|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_123.wav|23|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_030.wav|24|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_277.wav|15|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_103.wav|44|He went to see what he could learn.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_127.wav|6|He is the man to beat.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_056.wav|81|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_297.wav|107|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_294.wav|1|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_190.wav|28|You've just got to move on.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_205.wav|52|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_007.wav|3|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_059.wav|54|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_029.wav|89|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_394.wav|96|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_231.wav|23|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_259.wav|51|I thought that all musicians were the same.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_148.wav|72|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_243.wav|96|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_004.wav|59|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_119.wav|21|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_139.wav|8|Italy was just behind the US.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_008.wav|50|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_369.wav|9|That would help.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_252.wav|45|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_260.wav|96|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_157.wav|19|I am not blaming audiences.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_110.wav|18|But it was only a matter of time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_213.wav|63|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_030.wav|15|But there are no plans.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_122.wav|107|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_024.wav|54|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_189.wav|76|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_026.wav|78|It may be good for the soul.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_388.wav|38|I just don't know where he is.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_255.wav|70|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_259.wav|37|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_172.wav|44|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_116.wav|33|It's the way we go about it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_385.wav|13|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_029.wav|12|Of course, this is nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_188.wav|87|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_417.wav|4|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_061.wav|46|This is only the start of my season.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_154.wav|58|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_008.wav|52|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_351.wav|22|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_061.wav|75|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_170.wav|79|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_264.wav|41|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_139.wav|1|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_242.wav|16|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_107.wav|89|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_075.wav|7|I've had it for the exams.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_385.wav|8|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_109.wav|31|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_358.wav|105|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_303.wav|39|John was there already in spirit.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_380.wav|4|And it covers the spectrum.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_175.wav|42|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_081.wav|90|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_215.wav|23|We expect to come through on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_303.wav|101|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_157.wav|26|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_267.wav|97|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_180.wav|91|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_309.wav|2|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_109.wav|42|You need insurance to bring people in.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_414.wav|20|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_264.wav|102|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_128.wav|36|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_225.wav|40|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_309.wav|16|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_191.wav|22|We are seeking funds from government departments.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_274.wav|32|We accept the new rules.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_021.wav|100|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_012.wav|56|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_322.wav|81|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_186.wav|49|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_010.wav|35|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_005.wav|71|"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. "
DUMMY2/p307/p307_150.wav|22|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_130.wav|92|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_241.wav|52|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_050.wav|107|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_196.wav|11|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_120.wav|27|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_007.wav|4|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_221.wav|63|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_265.wav|77|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_103.wav|88|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_370.wav|21|There is always the smell.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_196.wav|20|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_362.wav|42|He had lost his confidence again.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_292.wav|7|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_321.wav|69|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_456.wav|24|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_252.wav|94|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_306.wav|27|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_417.wav|6|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_296.wav|10|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_187.wav|9|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_178.wav|54|He was lying face down in the water.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_303.wav|14|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_039.wav|44|We gave everything we had.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_127.wav|78|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_226.wav|9|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_222.wav|100|Seven people were critically injured.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_262.wav|60|He could still be President.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_187.wav|51|I certainly do not agree with that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_388.wav|77|My dad is all right.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_388.wav|41|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_404.wav|39|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_025.wav|87|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_164.wav|3|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_385.wav|11|What's the best thing to do?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_297.wav|35|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_335.wav|80|I must make that clear.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_142.wav|93|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_205.wav|68|I'm going with all three.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_049.wav|16|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_143.wav|88|It is sponsored by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_117.wav|82|It is really good news.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_224.wav|31|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_021.wav|87|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_366.wav|87|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_337.wav|44|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_186.wav|71|"I had a train to catch."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_044.wav|31|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_389.wav|89|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_092.wav|92|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_356.wav|54|The whole team was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_028.wav|97|It is so elusive and light.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_261.wav|92|I think it'll be a great occasion.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_386.wav|32|The pair are very much in love.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_112.wav|8|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_237.wav|29|We can certainly build on this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_077.wav|52|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_201.wav|42|I think it will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_335.wav|42|His primary residence is Scotland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_179.wav|64|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_325.wav|82|I am very happy with him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_408.wav|32|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_277.wav|7|You can feel at home in China.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_306.wav|59|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_316.wav|101|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_419.wav|33|What's it for, after all?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_332.wav|46|I know nothing about that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_163.wav|21|The latter way is my way.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_271.wav|38|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_093.wav|85|It's a much bigger problem.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_003.wav|52|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_339.wav|31|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_408.wav|72|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_359.wav|95|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_023.wav|76|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_245.wav|71|"We have got no money to go anywhere."
DUMMY2/p238/p238_105.wav|37|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_316.wav|76|But then they scored their fourth.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_155.wav|86|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_348.wav|91|He did not oppose the divorce.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_349.wav|11|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_055.wav|93|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_165.wav|42|Don't get me wrong.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_199.wav|57|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_269.wav|87|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_094.wav|105|She told The Herald.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_321.wav|36|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_222.wav|94|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_057.wav|75|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_338.wav|102|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_273.wav|37|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_094.wav|80|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_075.wav|12|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_026.wav|16|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_216.wav|51|I looked forward to it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_097.wav|11|However, this is only the start.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_388.wav|26|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_215.wav|83|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_279.wav|48|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_183.wav|22|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_032.wav|19|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_401.wav|32|He put some colour into Scottish history.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_045.wav|4|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_161.wav|107|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_453.wav|14|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_121.wav|104|We don't know what happened after.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_343.wav|41|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_312.wav|92|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_084.wav|19|That's why the ministers resigned.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_180.wav|31|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_221.wav|86|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_163.wav|85|It would help to heal the wounds.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_328.wav|56|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_068.wav|43|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_046.wav|59|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_357.wav|84|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_409.wav|15|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_109.wav|102|There are some new buildings in there.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_286.wav|81|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_227.wav|81|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_261.wav|49|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_083.wav|95|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_260.wav|16|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_074.wav|4|Already the children are dying.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_087.wav|10|It's not a holiday time for football players.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_307.wav|58|This must have been severe.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_406.wav|49|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_091.wav|84|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_188.wav|53|I didn't miss the big house at all.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_457.wav|75|And she is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_399.wav|39|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_317.wav|25|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_042.wav|27|We will push.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_232.wav|25|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_303.wav|105|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_059.wav|41|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_182.wav|40|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_202.wav|82|But who is the killer?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_118.wav|43|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_050.wav|79|It is the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_342.wav|45|I would miss him.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_051.wav|42|I would like to stay with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_321.wav|33|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_390.wav|22|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_220.wav|92|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_398.wav|18|My body is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_110.wav|52|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_178.wav|81|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_280.wav|84|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_363.wav|39|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_148.wav|23|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_352.wav|60|Golf is not like that.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_006.wav|102|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_248.wav|79|However we must not be complacent.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_198.wav|75|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_317.wav|6|Her concerns were not without foundation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_182.wav|61|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_327.wav|40|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_352.wav|46|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_331.wav|100|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_052.wav|50|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_082.wav|40|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_067.wav|18|And he's not a bigot.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_058.wav|37|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_270.wav|38|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_217.wav|105|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_360.wav|7|You may have a short memory.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_034.wav|85|There will always be problems on the way.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_423.wav|14|That's been all around Europe with me.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_315.wav|101|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_344.wav|104|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_065.wav|63|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_181.wav|0|It is a common problem.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_072.wav|49|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_344.wav|81|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_376.wav|48|It was launched in February last year.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_279.wav|16|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_259.wav|26|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_317.wav|34|This was not just incongruous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_122.wav|18|There could be a possible connection.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_037.wav|64|They were urged to get themselves in order.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_222.wav|83|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_266.wav|74|The people have been really friendly.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_210.wav|104|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_282.wav|23|We very much regret that it has occurred.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_386.wav|37|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_102.wav|73|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_046.wav|69|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_247.wav|77|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_122.wav|97|Our home is your home.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_313.wav|107|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_182.wav|82|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_057.wav|34|However this weekend it will be different.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_127.wav|53|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_234.wav|107|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_257.wav|68|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_388.wav|34|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_232.wav|83|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_131.wav|105|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_002.wav|23|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_441.wav|27|We were used.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_330.wav|11|We certainly have to try something.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_092.wav|32|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_049.wav|107|Happily we found it in the library.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_019.wav|82|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_364.wav|66|What's happening to her?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_374.wav|0|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_358.wav|100|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_113.wav|12|Look at them after three days of rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_172.wav|73|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_287.wav|95|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_314.wav|49|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_278.wav|12|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_174.wav|13|This is a very high price.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_181.wav|23|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_337.wav|39|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_368.wav|41|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_246.wav|37|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_081.wav|72|They had failed to explode.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_351.wav|98|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_021.wav|38|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_093.wav|49|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_311.wav|14|The effect was almost magical.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_382.wav|75|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_070.wav|60|His presence was very important.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_262.wav|32|He will go a long way.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_267.wav|95|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_255.wav|51|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_223.wav|4|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_345.wav|46|Our future was his future.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_439.wav|36|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_364.wav|103|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_082.wav|43|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_357.wav|58|Nobody ever gets to see them.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_336.wav|86|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_135.wav|16|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_267.wav|92|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_108.wav|28|I just saw them for a few minutes.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_111.wav|81|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_055.wav|74|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_455.wav|8|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_192.wav|17|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_130.wav|36|There were no serious injuries.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_168.wav|81|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_373.wav|27|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_200.wav|87|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_121.wav|101|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_067.wav|13|We tend to come good at the end.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_352.wav|34|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_394.wav|10|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_212.wav|20|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_071.wav|53|It turned me against the whole system.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_017.wav|15|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_108.wav|5|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_260.wav|59|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_379.wav|96|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_242.wav|94|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_037.wav|27|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_269.wav|72|I needed a little man in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_184.wav|94|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_102.wav|2|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_181.wav|7|Phase one was a shambles.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_139.wav|9|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_238.wav|25|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_290.wav|13|He already had had complaints.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_078.wav|94|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_048.wav|76|We were very much a happy family.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_141.wav|34|What exactly is your job?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_016.wav|47|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_059.wav|66|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_145.wav|1|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_138.wav|61|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_210.wav|46|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_090.wav|82|That, though, is an old story.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_178.wav|49|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_021.wav|66|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_272.wav|63|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_145.wav|57|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_044.wav|82|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_424.wav|79|But what took them so long?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_227.wav|0|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_348.wav|4|He added that he felt undermined.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_218.wav|51|I'd come back from London.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_159.wav|63|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_155.wav|94|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_209.wav|10|I am very realistic about these things.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_161.wav|11|It is a step up.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_122.wav|1|Some people still think she should be English.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_084.wav|2|This is the start of our season.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_033.wav|44|I think they should have more respect.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_307.wav|61|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_149.wav|79|There are no second chances.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_151.wav|17|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_185.wav|6|They were not consulted.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_325.wav|91|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_399.wav|78|I want this one to be different.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_373.wav|92|The voices told me to do it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_301.wav|98|It was complete nonsense.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_257.wav|65|We had a right to expect those days were over.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_269.wav|14|I didn't see the point.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_214.wav|56|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_028.wav|42|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_387.wav|53|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_120.wav|53|It is the right package for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_087.wav|90|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_086.wav|33|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_238.wav|8|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_153.wav|14|Does the name matter ?)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_062.wav|101|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_446.wav|8|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_216.wav|19|We are still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_305.wav|89|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_270.wav|100|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_094.wav|63|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_301.wav|41|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_085.wav|76|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_205.wav|62|They told him to go to drama school.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_313.wav|9|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_158.wav|83|Words were not required.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_402.wav|39|He replied that it was a dilemma.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_173.wav|67|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_190.wav|23|The fire was falling from the sky.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_224.wav|69|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_260.wav|62|It has to be long-term commitment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_341.wav|51|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_277.wav|34|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_281.wav|26|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_257.wav|86|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_167.wav|11|I'd never given up on myself.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_068.wav|31|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_025.wav|26|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_278.wav|51|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_356.wav|91|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_319.wav|97|So he is open to ideas.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_275.wav|5|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_005.wav|99|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_205.wav|34|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_342.wav|58|The urgency is real.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_362.wav|106|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_258.wav|103|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_037.wav|30|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_370.wav|29|We need to be prepared.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_250.wav|93|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_231.wav|54|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_009.wav|41|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_364.wav|102|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_289.wav|0|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_337.wav|14|We will listen to any suggestion.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_246.wav|87|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_079.wav|3|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_174.wav|54|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_041.wav|64|We have nothing to say about that.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_055.wav|38|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_213.wav|26|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_261.wav|43|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_210.wav|79|Their loss is heartbreaking.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_075.wav|78|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_256.wav|25|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_311.wav|100|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_287.wav|94|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_126.wav|67|Who would be a referee ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_146.wav|28|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_331.wav|87|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_315.wav|83|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_249.wav|100|I was just a kid.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_284.wav|23|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_055.wav|105|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_146.wav|82|For some, it was more painful than others.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_319.wav|69|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_107.wav|96|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_248.wav|71|"The car was just there."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_383.wav|33|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_174.wav|8|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_346.wav|102|English is the language of pop music.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_272.wav|71|"It's so awful."
DUMMY2/p251/p251_114.wav|9|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_112.wav|87|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_161.wav|63|Behind him was his brother.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_313.wav|12|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_261.wav|7|Italy is a beautiful place.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_033.wav|64|So now this series has had its day.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_104.wav|13|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_161.wav|71|"There's a pause."
DUMMY2/p280/p280_006.wav|52|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_125.wav|98|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_180.wav|40|He deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_245.wav|105|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_096.wav|10|We created so many chances.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_153.wav|69|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_228.wav|19|And then a funny thing happened.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_078.wav|5|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_015.wav|88|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_179.wav|87|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_411.wav|62|It was chaotic and frightening.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_035.wav|62|It was quite distressing for the crew.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_030.wav|65|Do not give your details to anyone.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_118.wav|48|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_176.wav|98|However, it does not tell the full story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_409.wav|34|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_186.wav|98|However, planners should be taking the lead.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_167.wav|76|It will not be easy for him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_072.wav|27|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_336.wav|23|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_244.wav|82|I get on him, he gets on me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_212.wav|1|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_409.wav|19|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_351.wav|37|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_370.wav|11|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_293.wav|70|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_171.wav|14|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_081.wav|88|That would be a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_151.wav|11|They may differ on other issues.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_353.wav|62|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_149.wav|61|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_219.wav|65|It was a piece of art.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_361.wav|35|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_133.wav|56|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_151.wav|15|I have nothing to regret.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_397.wav|104|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_216.wav|67|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_122.wav|4|But once again it was not converted.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_191.wav|99|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_010.wav|29|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_054.wav|77|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_302.wav|39|I have lost all confidence.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_323.wav|4|It will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_246.wav|39|That will be the criteria for the future.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_133.wav|98|It has been declared.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_284.wav|67|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_312.wav|95|It further expressed his defiance.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_156.wav|12|This is a foolish idea.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_441.wav|39|You have got to be careful.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_377.wav|85|So the Government will be damaged.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_066.wav|11|We were very much a happy family.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_005.wav|75|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_311.wav|40|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_195.wav|14|It shows the strength of the roots.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_410.wav|27|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_114.wav|14|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_255.wav|36|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_071.wav|103|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_079.wav|43|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_066.wav|60|Only the bomber was killed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_405.wav|32|The members have voted against it.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_011.wav|7|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p275/p275_416.wav|40|He is to appeal.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_423.wav|22|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_157.wav|2|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_038.wav|47|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_315.wav|107|It's like the Russians.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_056.wav|26|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_321.wav|32|What are they for ?)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_061.wav|106|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_320.wav|53|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_023.wav|96|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_327.wav|70|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_053.wav|2|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_152.wav|82|I still think he will win.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_319.wav|44|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_296.wav|8|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_150.wav|61|Is that Titanic ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_253.wav|99|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_283.wav|25|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_253.wav|4|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_121.wav|15|It's always the way.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_087.wav|42|That's how she wants to remember him.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_458.wav|95|She came to the Highland Show.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_247.wav|56|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_293.wav|26|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_058.wav|64|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_045.wav|9|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_051.wav|19|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_014.wav|64|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_270.wav|27|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_173.wav|82|It was like a kick in the belly.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_220.wav|93|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_030.wav|64|All would be under threat.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_292.wav|12|Everyone knew where they were.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_092.wav|39|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_157.wav|11|Scott and Emily were so happy.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_162.wav|63|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_207.wav|37|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_235.wav|80|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_163.wav|33|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_064.wav|41|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_322.wav|70|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_337.wav|9|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_182.wav|9|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_203.wav|38|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_251.wav|56|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_185.wav|30|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_227.wav|65|I was in daily contact.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_418.wav|104|Or, rather, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_307.wav|47|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_001.wav|34|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_402.wav|41|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_039.wav|19|It helped to get me noticed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_002.wav|106|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_043.wav|95|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_115.wav|21|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_371.wav|57|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_256.wav|21|It was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_150.wav|27|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_146.wav|57|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_220.wav|13|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_216.wav|96|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_064.wav|78|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_315.wav|66|We're all in a state of shock.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_406.wav|8|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_023.wav|89|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_230.wav|76|She asked us a lot of questions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_247.wav|38|So, the question is, is it any good?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_225.wav|64|How many cases have there been?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_362.wav|24|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_260.wav|2|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_331.wav|13|The company's in good shape.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_124.wav|97|There was no confusion over the second.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_127.wav|44|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_035.wav|41|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_355.wav|9|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_072.wav|57|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_078.wav|46|We cannot ask for them back.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_320.wav|100|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_011.wav|66|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_252.wav|39|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_191.wav|104|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_269.wav|95|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_147.wav|41|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_382.wav|56|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_369.wav|47|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_176.wav|39|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_037.wav|25|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_134.wav|86|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_356.wav|76|You've obviously got an answer to it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_276.wav|13|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_070.wav|29|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_205.wav|96|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_434.wav|24|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_175.wav|75|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_059.wav|67|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_024.wav|2|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_335.wav|107|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_401.wav|6|We are about to have our own Parliament.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_210.wav|29|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_278.wav|29|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_176.wav|96|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_384.wav|51|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_299.wav|92|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_208.wav|86|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_132.wav|33|But, still, it wasn't working.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_293.wav|52|They first met during a Step in London.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_344.wav|103|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_315.wav|16|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_194.wav|32|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_111.wav|71|"Who would be a referee?"
DUMMY2/p280/p280_016.wav|52|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_368.wav|91|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_203.wav|9|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_419.wav|106|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_240.wav|28|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_256.wav|76|The reason is partly because of tradition.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_168.wav|74|They did a very good job.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_111.wav|44|Only the scale of change differed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_323.wav|86|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_361.wav|104|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_060.wav|77|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_321.wav|73|It's very good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_103.wav|62|There may be some resistance.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_406.wav|38|This seems like a very good idea.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_164.wav|46|We were very much a happy family.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_297.wav|14|A revival is under way.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_028.wav|45|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_384.wav|24|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_390.wav|46|But there's no eye contact.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_255.wav|102|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_085.wav|19|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_046.wav|26|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_231.wav|57|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_140.wav|0|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_102.wav|82|There's something about being cut off.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_377.wav|18|This is a completely new experience for me.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_246.wav|25|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_263.wav|61|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_066.wav|54|I've had to take time off work today.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_049.wav|59|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_342.wav|0|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_139.wav|33|There has been no delay on government orders.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_452.wav|27|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_226.wav|100|It was a day for records.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_294.wav|4|So there is a very real dilemma.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_127.wav|29|Any success would have been an improvement.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_087.wav|65|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_221.wav|60|That has not changed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_006.wav|81|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_351.wav|13|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_046.wav|21|He died the following year.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_182.wav|52|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_155.wav|72|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_038.wav|67|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_418.wav|89|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_377.wav|94|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_347.wav|75|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_109.wav|87|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_305.wav|100|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_261.wav|22|We're not travel agents.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_227.wav|36|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_461.wav|32|The boys are mentally focused.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_245.wav|96|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_256.wav|65|We have brought the staff back on board.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_122.wav|37|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_049.wav|90|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_269.wav|83|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_154.wav|25|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_135.wav|102|However, details have yet to be worked out.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_283.wav|88|It is a victory to that extent.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_243.wav|107|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_207.wav|72|I love the moment of being first.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_224.wav|67|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_334.wav|87|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_082.wav|102|This is truly field of miracles.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_229.wav|39|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_116.wav|78|In the end we have to take a stand.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_241.wav|59|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_234.wav|15|They are not suitable.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_424.wav|36|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_322.wav|12|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_097.wav|66|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_373.wav|67|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_445.wav|24|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_086.wav|13|I am constantly changing my mind.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_243.wav|61|It's a dead end.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_182.wav|99|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_341.wav|74|She is deeply distressed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_084.wav|5|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_190.wav|42|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_005.wav|85|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_174.wav|11|The statement was a lie.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_099.wav|105|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_330.wav|58|It is the logical extension of audio description.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_045.wav|30|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_188.wav|33|There will be no change in government.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_004.wav|71|"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  "
DUMMY2/p294/p294_139.wav|104|The objective was achieved.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_158.wav|13|We should have gone solo.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_263.wav|103|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_120.wav|86|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_128.wav|1|It's much more dynamic.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_071.wav|43|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_015.wav|82|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_128.wav|29|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_024.wav|19|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_221.wav|54|They have enough intrusion at the time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_091.wav|45|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_062.wav|10|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_365.wav|8|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_016.wav|51|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_211.wav|59|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_459.wav|48|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_333.wav|10|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_444.wav|100|Gordon is also highly rated.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_384.wav|75|They know it'll be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_002.wav|88|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_323.wav|20|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_285.wav|50|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_308.wav|19|It was a simple question.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_332.wav|44|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_275.wav|65|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_379.wav|1|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_246.wav|33|He is under no illusions.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_406.wav|48|This game is very evenly balanced.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_176.wav|37|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_225.wav|102|And that gives a kind of freedom.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_215.wav|13|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_360.wav|32|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_344.wav|59|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_144.wav|67|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_138.wav|32|I think he's the favourite, no question.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_265.wav|6|This is the root of their problems.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_483.wav|65|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_080.wav|8|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_237.wav|79|It attracted no complaints.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_204.wav|71|"HARRY Potter has lost his magic."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_093.wav|89|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_300.wav|24|I understand the security issue.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_129.wav|34|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_192.wav|45|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_062.wav|13|Last night, the row continued.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_328.wav|91|He is young but not too young.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_312.wav|91|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_437.wav|37|We are aiming for early March.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_345.wav|0|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_292.wav|34|No decision has yet been made.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_238.wav|103|I would urge the Government to think again.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_280.wav|100|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_263.wav|24|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_184.wav|49|We didn't think anything would happen.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_046.wav|29|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_302.wav|73|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_290.wav|63|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_403.wav|11|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_310.wav|86|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_323.wav|24|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_057.wav|21|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_074.wav|42|Subtle it is not.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_388.wav|75|It brought in new management.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_260.wav|82|What is so unusual about this case?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_375.wav|7|Whether this return was too soon.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_329.wav|68|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_235.wav|0|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_315.wav|82|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_283.wav|76|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_029.wav|103|I fell in love with ballet.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_345.wav|56|There was a definite prejudice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_337.wav|105|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_429.wav|14|Such an attack is bizarre.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_278.wav|16|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_079.wav|85|The judge was very nice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_107.wav|86|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_317.wav|57|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_031.wav|73|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_168.wav|27|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_273.wav|15|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_165.wav|101|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_334.wav|20|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_433.wav|27|Everything has collapsed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_151.wav|79|I am extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_003.wav|16|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_083.wav|56|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_233.wav|102|He will become the sovereign.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_125.wav|29|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_338.wav|48|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_261.wav|23|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_134.wav|29|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_248.wav|105|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_034.wav|15|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_293.wav|91|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_270.wav|103|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_103.wav|0|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_364.wav|97|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_326.wav|40|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_234.wav|84|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_127.wav|4|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_084.wav|67|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_265.wav|105|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_337.wav|3|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_233.wav|89|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_352.wav|87|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_274.wav|81|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_155.wav|84|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_250.wav|24|She will attend in July.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_226.wav|44|This Government believes in parental discipline.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_423.wav|74|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_299.wav|96|He has retired.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_299.wav|39|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_226.wav|56|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_245.wav|52|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_404.wav|50|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_143.wav|80|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_291.wav|33|He's had a lot of injury problems.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_092.wav|74|This is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_268.wav|26|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_126.wav|99|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_297.wav|104|The acting left a lot to be desired.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_193.wav|51|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_243.wav|73|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_183.wav|8|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_415.wav|49|I am in a very difficult position.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_400.wav|85|Well, there you go.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_453.wav|24|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_355.wav|14|But the New Year was special.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_094.wav|19|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_152.wav|41|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_210.wav|77|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_160.wav|83|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_228.wav|13|Human beings are always the same.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_252.wav|28|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_029.wav|88|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_281.wav|58|The whole team was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_051.wav|33|This isn't a gimmick.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_109.wav|72|I can't believe it's all gone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_319.wav|19|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_216.wav|14|was everything done to save people ?)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_297.wav|3|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_463.wav|24|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_012.wav|90|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_270.wav|21|That is a question for the next manager.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_268.wav|0|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_319.wav|26|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_267.wav|41|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_326.wav|46|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_327.wav|37|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_387.wav|49|It's our worst nightmare.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_418.wav|77|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_122.wav|86|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_008.wav|57|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_411.wav|39|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_186.wav|81|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_296.wav|32|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_067.wav|14|It came as a surprise.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_247.wav|36|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_074.wav|59|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_045.wav|1|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_066.wav|12|He also does not get on with Christina.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_324.wav|27|It will work.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_024.wav|32|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_379.wav|72|Motorists will welcome this.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_099.wav|10|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_228.wav|96|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_131.wav|15|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_188.wav|42|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_160.wav|12|She collapsed and died a day later.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_066.wav|39|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_334.wav|67|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_433.wav|32|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_195.wav|25|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_093.wav|92|Nothing has changed from the season before.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_134.wav|92|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_310.wav|0|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_362.wav|64|They have two children.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_210.wav|95|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_494.wav|75|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_135.wav|105|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_153.wav|82|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_112.wav|85|It has until Saturday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_445.wav|75|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_290.wav|87|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_351.wav|41|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_282.wav|54|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_386.wav|10|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_073.wav|52|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_223.wav|14|His third goal was superb.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_177.wav|48|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_305.wav|28|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_243.wav|77|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_231.wav|45|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_144.wav|38|The world is split into two.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_312.wav|36|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_190.wav|32|Aberdeen had little to offer.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_133.wav|96|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_146.wav|5|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_177.wav|27|It is really good news.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_361.wav|99|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_069.wav|57|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_343.wav|17|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_354.wav|17|I could have been offended.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_293.wav|105|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p341/p341_145.wav|66|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_211.wav|54|So people will come out with these things.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_261.wav|71|"Immediate action must be taken."
DUMMY2/p244/p244_252.wav|78|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_333.wav|93|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_347.wav|65|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_043.wav|32|He will need that machine.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_124.wav|3|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_150.wav|87|I was given no instructions by no-one.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_367.wav|39|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_304.wav|64|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_070.wav|68|Repayment is not part of the game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_402.wav|49|The review has been conducted fairly.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_123.wav|89|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_404.wav|74|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_394.wav|105|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_293.wav|100|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_085.wav|34|Are you up for business?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_271.wav|1|For this government, reform and resources go together.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_267.wav|51|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_140.wav|39|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_309.wav|47|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_216.wav|43|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_084.wav|66|They are going to carry it through.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_119.wav|74|And it worked, so we kept it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_339.wav|42|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_255.wav|45|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_456.wav|100|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_052.wav|12|It's a grey area.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_303.wav|91|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_392.wav|102|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_237.wav|49|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_080.wav|62|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_376.wav|0|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_396.wav|54|The workers said they were treated like animals.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_016.wav|56|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_073.wav|100|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_328.wav|50|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_349.wav|22|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_217.wav|6|I was amazed at her knowledge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_083.wav|63|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_040.wav|32|Well, he is an artist.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_077.wav|11|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_253.wav|105|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_035.wav|87|It's as we were yesterday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_206.wav|35|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_133.wav|92|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_300.wav|48|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_038.wav|65|It was a total surprise.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_122.wav|105|He did his job.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_326.wav|7|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_072.wav|85|It has certainly paid off for him.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_251.wav|104|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_134.wav|58|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_253.wav|35|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_017.wav|42|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_191.wav|53|You are not long home from work.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_291.wav|7|He took over our lives.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_341.wav|63|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_038.wav|71|"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_016.wav|5|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_314.wav|22|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_031.wav|25|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_442.wav|36|It is pretty bad news.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_399.wav|56|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_065.wav|55|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_304.wav|44|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_310.wav|92|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_370.wav|98|We are all in the frontline.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_246.wav|22|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_037.wav|46|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_129.wav|39|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_411.wav|92|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_099.wav|75|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_089.wav|22|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_233.wav|98|The lads are having a tour.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_169.wav|89|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_072.wav|13|He was between people and God.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_092.wav|5|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_138.wav|7|Scotland will finish the group in second place.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_400.wav|11|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_344.wav|77|I think it's about time.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_385.wav|37|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_343.wav|2|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_118.wav|22|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_297.wav|99|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_330.wav|32|We're not an employment agency.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_038.wav|41|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_217.wav|78|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_284.wav|12|We said, What do you mean?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_246.wav|54|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_314.wav|47|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_381.wav|96|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_377.wav|106|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_349.wav|69|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_077.wav|9|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_225.wav|100|He must get to know himself.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_118.wav|107|Stalkers are capable of killing.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_160.wav|63|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_181.wav|47|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_405.wav|56|I've had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_212.wav|48|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_217.wav|85|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_033.wav|107|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_008.wav|42|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_300.wav|20|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_230.wav|90|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_352.wav|39|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_200.wav|66|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_033.wav|26|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_314.wav|46|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_339.wav|7|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_393.wav|65|No, because they look good boys.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_065.wav|103|It was the same old story.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_191.wav|97|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_209.wav|11|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_326.wav|75|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_032.wav|4|We keep a distance.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_062.wav|102|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_315.wav|74|I'm going to win the next two.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_069.wav|39|It is the only way forward for the club.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_171.wav|55|That apart, though, I feel good.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_303.wav|92|They know their son was murdered.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_045.wav|89|He's just in it for himself.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_222.wav|67|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_255.wav|98|I can understand why they have gone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_324.wav|73|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_210.wav|88|I'm not interested in money.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_282.wav|0|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_113.wav|43|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_280.wav|86|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_095.wav|68|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_104.wav|98|It was one of the firemen.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_310.wav|62|I would say so.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_019.wav|77|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_055.wav|103|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_174.wav|24|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_278.wav|8|He could see no other bidder.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_300.wav|21|This has got to stop.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_162.wav|77|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_388.wav|94|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_308.wav|23|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_413.wav|34|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_306.wav|102|Their message was simple.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_027.wav|38|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_034.wav|0|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_305.wav|41|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_436.wav|39|As it turned out it was a triumph.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_387.wav|89|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_268.wav|33|It's got to come from me.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_215.wav|75|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_110.wav|96|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_174.wav|37|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_400.wav|106|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_254.wav|106|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_189.wav|53|The story was not made public by this club.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_287.wav|66|Make sure you see it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_314.wav|98|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_047.wav|17|I hope you will leave it at that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_253.wav|57|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_348.wav|106|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_028.wav|3|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_216.wav|33|Which is fair enough.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_375.wav|1|I don't know exactly what happened.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_196.wav|29|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_231.wav|29|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_129.wav|16|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_421.wav|22|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_013.wav|53|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_263.wav|28|I ran to get out of the way.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_067.wav|17|Once again, he refused.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_309.wav|55|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_066.wav|55|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_391.wav|40|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_347.wav|33|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_131.wav|100|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_318.wav|70|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_322.wav|62|We don't have the credible evidence.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_036.wav|40|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_416.wav|20|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_022.wav|88|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_155.wav|77|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_123.wav|79|I will just have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_212.wav|3|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_369.wav|78|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_152.wav|91|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_085.wav|28|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_235.wav|31|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_125.wav|65|We beat the Welsh team.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_055.wav|82|Others said he had gone too far.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_271.wav|106|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_005.wav|47|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_372.wav|15|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_198.wav|25|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_039.wav|0|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_059.wav|21|I don't believe in gesture politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_169.wav|54|That is where the club has gone wrong.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_098.wav|46|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_411.wav|17|We have high hopes that this will work.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_214.wav|78|This conference was never confirmed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_438.wav|14|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_130.wav|6|Which brings us to the question of money.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_391.wav|75|The following day I used the story.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_221.wav|37|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_171.wav|31|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_220.wav|35|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_420.wav|20|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_061.wav|47|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_213.wav|82|I want to put myself on discussion also.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_172.wav|24|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_288.wav|35|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_106.wav|36|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_178.wav|40|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_057.wav|31|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_225.wav|23|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_244.wav|100|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_363.wav|46|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_302.wav|91|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_076.wav|38|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_087.wav|60|It seems very odd.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_417.wav|65|A report will be issued by March.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_383.wav|68|Mike Tyson went to prison.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_383.wav|87|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_154.wav|66|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_371.wav|25|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_132.wav|70|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_257.wav|56|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_072.wav|3|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_251.wav|89|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_366.wav|74|The past is history, not destiny.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_281.wav|102|This is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_351.wav|28|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_036.wav|67|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_312.wav|67|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_242.wav|85|Every case is completely different.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_434.wav|63|The growth potential is enormous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_435.wav|32|Its failure is no surprise.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_059.wav|29|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_173.wav|31|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_364.wav|72|That's how she wants to remember him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_264.wav|51|He is young but not too young.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_289.wav|29|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_178.wav|107|For now, we must take one game at a time.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_274.wav|13|It won't be their last.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_151.wav|30|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_301.wav|75|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_067.wav|85|What on earth is wrong with you?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_153.wav|87|It's very dangerous for markets.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_323.wav|65|Someone should tell them.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_174.wav|1|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_168.wav|59|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_091.wav|47|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_391.wav|65|The experts got it wrong.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_145.wav|48|We just have to adapt.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_254.wav|58|One of these problems is the railways.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_126.wav|19|What's the point?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_365.wav|85|I am delighted to have her back home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_112.wav|31|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_293.wav|107|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_102.wav|25|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_096.wav|85|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_357.wav|95|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_369.wav|82|He will take it in his stride.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_173.wav|41|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_314.wav|4|Yes, it was uplifting.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_203.wav|69|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_202.wav|9|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_226.wav|25|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_260.wav|69|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_281.wav|72|At the election we will oppose the euro.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_346.wav|107|Managers and clinicians must work together.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_141.wav|103|That is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_248.wav|55|We have several options.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_336.wav|34|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_243.wav|64|This is the subway.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_427.wav|37|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_030.wav|80|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_307.wav|45|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_246.wav|27|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_291.wav|60|We've been here before.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_249.wav|102|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_056.wav|83|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_077.wav|84|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_040.wav|79|Why you did it will never be known.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_098.wav|86|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_010.wav|68|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_275.wav|1|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_122.wav|91|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_083.wav|40|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_163.wav|27|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_389.wav|106|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_298.wav|75|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_081.wav|79|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_167.wav|26|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_042.wav|34|What is next?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_066.wav|40|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_395.wav|8|It sounds like a wish list.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_335.wav|36|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_030.wav|38|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_037.wav|32|They said she was stable.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_040.wav|25|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_453.wav|106|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_413.wav|64|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_083.wav|55|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_410.wav|69|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_423.wav|7|I've had a wonderful career.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_251.wav|85|What a difference a game can make.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_398.wav|48|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_393.wav|50|But we are very near.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_339.wav|97|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_371.wav|8|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_073.wav|7|It was a unanimous decision.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_388.wav|33|He, too, was not satisfied.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_353.wav|93|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_113.wav|45|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_097.wav|1|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_388.wav|8|Last season was very hard for me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_237.wav|63|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_009.wav|57|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_328.wav|62|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_381.wav|46|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_025.wav|11|She had to learn a new discipline.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_338.wav|39|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_090.wav|78|It seems a good thing to try.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_225.wav|70|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_194.wav|5|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_183.wav|105|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_097.wav|51|Correction, knowing him, he might.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_179.wav|69|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_225.wav|60|The club has never won it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_290.wav|72|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_335.wav|14|Scotland has shown the way.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_401.wav|36|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_296.wav|36|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_077.wav|93|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_310.wav|23|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_005.wav|63|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_376.wav|27|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_071.wav|24|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_239.wav|2|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_170.wav|9|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_257.wav|88|That can happen so easily.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_319.wav|63|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_217.wav|40|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_203.wav|4|However, planners should be taking the lead.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_042.wav|102|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_152.wav|96|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_422.wav|37|The company declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_063.wav|23|He had other things on his mind.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_151.wav|32|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_220.wav|40|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_352.wav|41|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_307.wav|20|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_233.wav|76|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_401.wav|60|You will need it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_185.wav|25|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_241.wav|69|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_091.wav|90|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_266.wav|101|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_225.wav|17|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_074.wav|43|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_263.wav|3|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_120.wav|74|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_127.wav|27|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_418.wav|4|I agree with them.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_274.wav|98|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_001.wav|81|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_374.wav|93|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_226.wav|86|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_024.wav|33|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_236.wav|77|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_026.wav|70|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_305.wav|5|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_096.wav|7|We would have concerns about that.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_249.wav|89|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_110.wav|65|You can maintain regular contact.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_078.wav|35|This is a true story.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_149.wav|24|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_072.wav|28|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_149.wav|12|I feel my life to be at risk.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_340.wav|40|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_007.wav|22|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_387.wav|33|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_078.wav|106|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_177.wav|30|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_273.wav|47|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_406.wav|13|A suspicion was not enough.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_421.wav|107|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_055.wav|75|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_128.wav|60|But they are a good team.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_366.wav|33|We are not asking for the moon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_263.wav|33|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_040.wav|106|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_316.wav|70|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_191.wav|85|I just love lessons.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_343.wav|57|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_375.wav|89|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_237.wav|69|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_364.wav|46|I was a little surprised.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_236.wav|45|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_305.wav|73|It will work.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_167.wav|88|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_224.wav|47|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_281.wav|51|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_091.wav|20|It's good news.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_188.wav|59|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_183.wav|81|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_032.wav|40|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_382.wav|38|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_052.wav|102|It's a grey area.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_404.wav|10|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_033.wav|14|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_232.wav|85|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_365.wav|21|We had to take action to protect them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_288.wav|53|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_267.wav|71|"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_214.wav|66|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_162.wav|67|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_243.wav|104|But happily, the story is true.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_342.wav|28|You never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_228.wav|24|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_433.wav|7|Three years ago he would have been.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_342.wav|87|Plans were made to expand.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_368.wav|92|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_299.wav|50|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_335.wav|39|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_093.wav|94|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_090.wav|15|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_026.wav|46|We still have a long, long way to go.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_105.wav|48|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_110.wav|101|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_239.wav|72|He is a joy to watch.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_273.wav|58|Are you in this movie?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_151.wav|50|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_255.wav|106|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_430.wav|56|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_068.wav|86|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_003.wav|1|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_343.wav|61|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_091.wav|41|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_374.wav|102|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_072.wav|77|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_399.wav|25|I have been in good form for the last two years.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_265.wav|55|The proposal was rejected.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_169.wav|34|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_156.wav|34|They should not have behaved in that way.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_248.wav|90|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_298.wav|52|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_191.wav|81|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_126.wav|71|"Twaddle is a case in point."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_172.wav|82|If only the acting profession was that simple.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_147.wav|75|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_322.wav|85|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_043.wav|88|The concept is simple.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_289.wav|62|Who will take them after that?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_118.wav|9|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_393.wav|10|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_314.wav|25|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_191.wav|90|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_192.wav|102|These elements are not in the book.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_203.wav|67|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_042.wav|15|The chances were plentiful.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_272.wav|69|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_378.wav|24|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_267.wav|93|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_208.wav|3|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_097.wav|77|It's not a lack of confidence.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_239.wav|73|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_089.wav|60|We discovered that for ourselves.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_361.wav|15|Doesn't he miss it?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_130.wav|55|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_094.wav|6|What has happened?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_008.wav|106|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_197.wav|100|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_003.wav|21|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_175.wav|27|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_423.wav|27|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_486.wav|65|The accident seemed so simple.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_244.wav|103|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_015.wav|46|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_101.wav|38|I would never even consider it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_318.wav|76|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_090.wav|28|There has been a sense of frustration.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_249.wav|3|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_281.wav|57|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_037.wav|80|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_367.wav|55|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_282.wav|19|I'm confident we can do that.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_329.wav|92|These findings are vitally important.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_150.wav|17|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_094.wav|98|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_399.wav|87|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_029.wav|92|It has been supremely successful.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_032.wav|77|But a solution has been found.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_004.wav|107|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_290.wav|1|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_304.wav|58|What went wrong?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_031.wav|0|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_210.wav|41|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_129.wav|45|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_078.wav|28|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_038.wav|93|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_054.wav|37|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_086.wav|103|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_408.wav|79|It is believed he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_058.wav|40|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_281.wav|64|Arguably, they have already done it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_289.wav|86|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_100.wav|105|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_373.wav|107|You have to audition for jobs.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_241.wav|94|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_116.wav|56|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_333.wav|8|It is far too early.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_311.wav|67|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_279.wav|38|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_104.wav|16|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_101.wav|41|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_056.wav|66|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_094.wav|47|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_398.wav|49|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_246.wav|24|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_245.wav|97|I now know that from memory.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_051.wav|38|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_124.wav|47|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_376.wav|16|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_287.wav|78|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_145.wav|31|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_175.wav|33|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_138.wav|51|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_006.wav|63|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_392.wav|103|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_303.wav|26|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_151.wav|54|They just made me feel dizzy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_167.wav|29|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_121.wav|3|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_397.wav|89|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_142.wav|42|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_169.wav|71|"You had to go and see him."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_123.wav|45|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_384.wav|63|The team hadn't been picked.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_377.wav|62|The referee didn't do his job.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_108.wav|100|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_354.wav|23|Failure is a curious concept.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_051.wav|3|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_219.wav|96|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_044.wav|91|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_171.wav|94|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_084.wav|61|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_061.wav|10|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_177.wav|7|The people are the hero.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_337.wav|11|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_175.wav|89|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_169.wav|78|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_080.wav|73|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_189.wav|73|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_275.wav|57|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_105.wav|43|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_454.wav|50|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_425.wav|40|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_140.wav|54|Thus far we have received no complaints.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_305.wav|17|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_117.wav|52|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_179.wav|82|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_371.wav|49|This means a great deal to the families.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_462.wav|39|I saw it didn't work.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_220.wav|46|It could not be too high.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_236.wav|0|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_061.wav|55|The fifth was found later.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_160.wav|58|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_353.wav|75|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_296.wav|23|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_304.wav|34|How good is Lennox Lewis?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_108.wav|49|They have got their position, we have got our position.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_263.wav|17|It really is taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_163.wav|4|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_428.wav|36|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_373.wav|103|They probably expected something special from me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_346.wav|58|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_051.wav|84|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_096.wav|52|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_092.wav|103|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_340.wav|81|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_407.wav|46|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_050.wav|24|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_039.wav|91|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_386.wav|39|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_444.wav|95|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_279.wav|7|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_050.wav|50|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_278.wav|4|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_146.wav|41|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_215.wav|9|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_391.wav|76|There are a number of possible outcomes.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_336.wav|56|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_396.wav|68|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_243.wav|60|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_258.wav|3|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_298.wav|94|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_163.wav|96|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_382.wav|98|I spoke to him yesterday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_265.wav|81|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_283.wav|24|I felt about this big.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_311.wav|104|They have nowhere else to go.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_339.wav|53|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_407.wav|78|It's great that it happened in Britain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_195.wav|73|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_313.wav|3|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_036.wav|95|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_371.wav|31|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_301.wav|8|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_069.wav|107|I hope we can put it behind us.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_256.wav|87|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_064.wav|66|This is the crossroads.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_036.wav|32|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_317.wav|14|He was obviously very genuine.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_047.wav|81|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_031.wav|4|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_114.wav|54|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_183.wav|95|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_124.wav|15|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_241.wav|38|It had won an investors in people award.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_118.wav|27|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_060.wav|59|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_065.wav|90|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_459.wav|7|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_151.wav|75|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_337.wav|29|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_313.wav|16|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_090.wav|96|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_103.wav|7|It's good to have a voice.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_335.wav|105|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_321.wav|31|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_256.wav|57|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_066.wav|92|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_178.wav|43|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_142.wav|6|I was deeply worried.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_006.wav|96|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_201.wav|12|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_443.wav|8|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_304.wav|82|This club have been fair to me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_178.wav|44|You let a lot of people down.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_097.wav|70|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_238.wav|59|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_288.wav|4|It has become very confused.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_371.wav|4|This was a chilling echo.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_340.wav|73|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_140.wav|13|I've got to get on with my career.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_080.wav|19|Did they give any good advice?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_169.wav|103|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_247.wav|50|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_411.wav|7|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_392.wav|72|That's the way things are heading.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_185.wav|52|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_288.wav|42|We want to replicate that success.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_333.wav|51|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_333.wav|104|Iraq has no interest in war.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_305.wav|63|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_363.wav|98|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_345.wav|87|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_118.wav|90|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_094.wav|103|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_326.wav|83|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_326.wav|72|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_178.wav|76|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_123.wav|46|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_360.wav|8|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_285.wav|19|I would never even consider it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_402.wav|1|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_011.wav|59|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_095.wav|24|It is high time to act.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_067.wav|2|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_195.wav|89|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_036.wav|52|Each brand was owned by a different family.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_058.wav|85|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_349.wav|33|She kept him on a string.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_171.wav|70|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_308.wav|106|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_108.wav|92|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_300.wav|89|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_118.wav|103|That is different from being impartial.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_212.wav|63|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_046.wav|60|And maybe they have.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_325.wav|94|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_262.wav|11|I have not come in to take over.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_314.wav|77|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_209.wav|52|They are a victim of their own success.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_062.wav|30|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_407.wav|74|We shall not do that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_332.wav|94|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_459.wav|65|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_028.wav|72|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_151.wav|56|I'm not going to answer that right now.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_086.wav|70|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_094.wav|32|He is not a dancer.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_146.wav|95|It's not a U-turn at all.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_148.wav|75|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_257.wav|74|I can't believe it happened.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_026.wav|69|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_356.wav|53|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_280.wav|8|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_134.wav|95|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_459.wav|32|Now that business is banned.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_017.wav|77|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_098.wav|65|how do you get it back?)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_154.wav|0|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_271.wav|49|Some may end up in hospital.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_300.wav|92|It should be a condition of employment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_248.wav|29|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_214.wav|107|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_054.wav|72|And then came the seventies.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_343.wav|58|The criminal justice system does not do that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_298.wav|65|Many events are down on numbers.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_178.wav|48|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_316.wav|46|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_162.wav|92|David Trimble has sold out.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_074.wav|100|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_314.wav|5|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_142.wav|89|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_254.wav|70|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_227.wav|85|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_033.wav|2|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_189.wav|9|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_204.wav|47|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_172.wav|8|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_360.wav|41|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_340.wav|52|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_177.wav|8|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_286.wav|40|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_359.wav|83|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_270.wav|80|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_113.wav|40|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_151.wav|13|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_447.wav|7|I never had a childhood.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_057.wav|77|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_385.wav|63|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_063.wav|28|He will become the sovereign.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_315.wav|26|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_109.wav|82|What are they like?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_455.wav|106|We are aiming for early March.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_351.wav|73|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_477.wav|75|Analysts said the offer was fair.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_081.wav|14|She died in hospital two hours later.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_048.wav|84|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_376.wav|2|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_144.wav|55|I'd always wanted to act.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_189.wav|71|"I would love it."
DUMMY2/p284/p284_161.wav|16|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_099.wav|88|He liked to talk.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_148.wav|35|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_356.wav|86|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_097.wav|43|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_144.wav|78|I have been in contact with him.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_341.wav|85|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_316.wav|97|I was in the zone in the morning.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_096.wav|84|I had a bit in hand.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_410.wav|100|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_322.wav|95|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_122.wav|45|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_284.wav|75|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_188.wav|72|Did you see that?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_312.wav|75|It was really very frightening.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_132.wav|105|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_028.wav|78|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_066.wav|69|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_145.wav|93|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_009.wav|11|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_340.wav|14|The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_286.wav|93|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_100.wav|88|Lots of others were doing the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_164.wav|67|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_437.wav|63|That was a great performance by the team.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_260.wav|57|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_113.wav|9|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_201.wav|107|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_150.wav|11|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_177.wav|3|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_473.wav|48|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_176.wav|68|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_267.wav|29|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_348.wav|8|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_129.wav|0|He was seen as the enemy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_486.wav|75|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_454.wav|63|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_186.wav|79|It was a bit of a shock.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_393.wav|35|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_388.wav|65|The view is impressive.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_345.wav|19|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_163.wav|48|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_027.wav|42|And the art of performance is taking risks.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_350.wav|75|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_417.wav|27|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_379.wav|104|He edited the press release.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_181.wav|87|Pressure of work is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_402.wav|63|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_164.wav|41|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_156.wav|75|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_224.wav|56|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_240.wav|53|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_148.wav|14|What happened in that game ?)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_022.wav|34|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_024.wav|13|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_226.wav|57|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_450.wav|89|It was a total disaster.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_151.wav|59|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_300.wav|77|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_210.wav|20|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_262.wav|59|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_448.wav|39|It is not over by any means.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_187.wav|46|I think we're very different.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_078.wav|66|It does not stop at the border.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_383.wav|105|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_375.wav|29|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_402.wav|14|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_141.wav|52|I am not under any new pressure.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_292.wav|0|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_169.wav|94|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_362.wav|68|As if he were a High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_253.wav|32|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_304.wav|47|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_204.wav|32|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_184.wav|33|The parties have no contact.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_172.wav|97|Each day is a new beginning.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_389.wav|25|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_351.wav|102|This time, however, there is a new venue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_143.wav|83|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_153.wav|17|This is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_259.wav|67|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_353.wav|58|I am ready for that.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_005.wav|70|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_386.wav|55|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_075.wav|106|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_235.wav|17|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_124.wav|66|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_406.wav|54|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_225.wav|50|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_124.wav|14|We have the mental strength.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_163.wav|52|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_083.wav|106|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_369.wav|68|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_231.wav|55|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_056.wav|11|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_154.wav|71|"Mr Blair had done well."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_383.wav|15|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_044.wav|37|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_062.wav|3|That is all in the past.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_116.wav|45|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_318.wav|63|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_231.wav|88|I could not believe the results.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_084.wav|64|But will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_319.wav|3|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_129.wav|33|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_333.wav|13|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_241.wav|30|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_165.wav|21|It is one of those things.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_144.wav|68|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_029.wav|82|What is the new religion?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_097.wav|38|It means they actually control the programme.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_002.wav|73|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_263.wav|15|We could have done without this.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_214.wav|49|That is not an easy thing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_214.wav|53|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_369.wav|26|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_397.wav|4|He said no survivors had been found.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_003.wav|23|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_260.wav|77|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_241.wav|102|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_095.wav|77|It would be the end of farming.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_201.wav|68|It was a very difficult decision for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_282.wav|74|We might never see him again.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_156.wav|31|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_070.wav|92|He's right up to a point.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_301.wav|92|It was not being marketed properly.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_115.wav|63|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_208.wav|78|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_132.wav|87|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_350.wav|60|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_201.wav|39|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_320.wav|89|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_412.wav|42|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_333.wav|42|He intends to appeal the sentences.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_172.wav|31|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_074.wav|41|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_158.wav|11|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_454.wav|100|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_212.wav|12|He was too good for me - too consistent.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_342.wav|91|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_325.wav|52|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_276.wav|28|He made no big mistakes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_297.wav|20|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_365.wav|49|But let's not get carried away.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_311.wav|25|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_111.wav|98|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_301.wav|94|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_280.wav|34|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_080.wav|89|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_391.wav|84|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_418.wav|0|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_078.wav|78|That will be the office.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_209.wav|59|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_273.wav|103|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_174.wav|42|But what lies ahead?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_320.wav|6|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_379.wav|93|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_044.wav|21|I had troubles with the producers.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_320.wav|81|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_420.wav|64|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_066.wav|38|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_014.wav|30|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_047.wav|46|You can't give in to the vandals.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_103.wav|50|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_154.wav|32|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_358.wav|60|That has to be allowed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_281.wav|23|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_104.wav|73|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_321.wav|53|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_311.wav|24|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_002.wav|48|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_248.wav|5|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_395.wav|79|That will be the criteria for the future.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_407.wav|47|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_107.wav|58|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_361.wav|105|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_044.wav|51|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_256.wav|4|The performance was really, really immense.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_359.wav|25|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_282.wav|25|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_289.wav|104|So it was sad.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_047.wav|33|We know we can defend it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_084.wav|4|They are there to help us.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_063.wav|107|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_335.wav|45|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_389.wav|20|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_308.wav|104|The appeal is impartial.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_271.wav|17|It was also put on the Internet.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_136.wav|27|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_381.wav|31|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_228.wav|86|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_078.wav|73|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_111.wav|84|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_245.wav|87|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_189.wav|32|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_203.wav|10|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_233.wav|20|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_058.wav|28|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_299.wav|81|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_293.wav|9|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_253.wav|74|I am not a liar.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_141.wav|37|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_427.wav|106|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_352.wav|44|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_046.wav|23|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_402.wav|72|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_226.wav|68|This Government believes in parental discipline.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_077.wav|95|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_136.wav|44|It was to be published next month.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_188.wav|18|He loved it, and so did they.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_237.wav|12|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_229.wav|86|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_325.wav|107|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_224.wav|90|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_304.wav|103|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_214.wav|77|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_095.wav|35|We intend to change the model.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_175.wav|53|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_337.wav|92|We are well insured.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_149.wav|10|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_154.wav|30|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_288.wav|27|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_213.wav|44|They should also have the right to vote.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_185.wav|28|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_218.wav|99|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_023.wav|27|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_257.wav|100|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_138.wav|77|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_241.wav|54|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_353.wav|105|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_087.wav|69|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_279.wav|26|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_022.wav|37|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_172.wav|27|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_041.wav|21|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_276.wav|98|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_057.wav|27|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_312.wav|85|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_277.wav|29|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_092.wav|25|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_255.wav|81|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_277.wav|22|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_120.wav|88|Who will take them after that?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_166.wav|47|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_237.wav|96|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_115.wav|37|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_170.wav|87|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_337.wav|81|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_347.wav|68|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_177.wav|55|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_164.wav|49|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_312.wav|24|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_333.wav|97|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_167.wav|71|"By then, however, both men were already in the US."
DUMMY2/p260/p260_292.wav|81|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_292.wav|31|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_399.wav|33|Where does it come from?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_196.wav|58|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_089.wav|69|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_038.wav|60|I had to be into it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_219.wav|81|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_159.wav|52|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_301.wav|66|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_070.wav|101|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_143.wav|106|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_002.wav|17|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_326.wav|45|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_016.wav|96|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_100.wav|23|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_359.wav|91|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_218.wav|96|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_018.wav|100|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_111.wav|72|We will meet again.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_039.wav|27|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_125.wav|6|This is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_335.wav|8|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_298.wav|26|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_058.wav|12|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_278.wav|81|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_303.wav|56|His appeal is instantly understood.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_284.wav|78|It is important that he is involved.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_269.wav|85|This is a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_320.wav|27|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_328.wav|60|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_383.wav|64|Is that where we are?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_374.wav|21|He is lying to save his skin.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_246.wav|59|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_298.wav|97|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_164.wav|58|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_248.wav|77|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_303.wav|104|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_051.wav|67|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_450.wav|65|We are unable to provide support for future issues.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_101.wav|97|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_150.wav|1|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_063.wav|75|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_189.wav|58|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_249.wav|84|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_127.wav|13|But the killer remains at large.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_052.wav|100|It is on the news.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_424.wav|46|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_108.wav|14|We made a world record together.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_040.wav|37|I remember that day well.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_208.wav|9|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_324.wav|93|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_397.wav|14|They have not done so this season so far.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_359.wav|15|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_186.wav|77|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_115.wav|43|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_121.wav|48|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_104.wav|17|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_161.wav|5|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_066.wav|43|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_196.wav|17|I will wait until later.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_235.wav|73|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_271.wav|66|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_369.wav|31|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_398.wav|4|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_360.wav|104|The trial continues today.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_329.wav|57|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_109.wav|90|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_222.wav|60|It's a creative energy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_099.wav|51|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_229.wav|64|Our job is to change that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_281.wav|2|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_359.wav|3|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_031.wav|90|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_466.wav|75|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_272.wav|64|That's a very strong element.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_414.wav|100|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_289.wav|45|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_318.wav|77|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_331.wav|23|He is in charge on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_289.wav|10|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_068.wav|80|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_222.wav|2|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_047.wav|20|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_319.wav|96|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_157.wav|60|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_198.wav|104|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_222.wav|1|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_106.wav|63|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_023.wav|26|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_134.wav|22|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_322.wav|97|There is no right to appeal.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_115.wav|23|The door is open.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_384.wav|28|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_351.wav|105|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_193.wav|33|This was an hour before the show.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_200.wav|60|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_226.wav|18|The signs are positive.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_085.wav|71|"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_242.wav|71|"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_009.wav|7|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
DUMMY2/p253/p253_016.wav|70|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_005.wav|55|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_069.wav|79|He said it was for sale.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_072.wav|103|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_093.wav|51|Action must be taken urgently.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_334.wav|7|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_194.wav|87|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_260.wav|60|We couldn't believe it at first.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_116.wav|36|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_055.wav|10|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_367.wav|19|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_079.wav|21|I am looking forward to getting home.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_408.wav|104|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_230.wav|71|"It's very safe."
DUMMY2/p374/p374_147.wav|11|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_186.wav|61|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_216.wav|2|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_259.wav|46|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_186.wav|82|You have a plan?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_064.wav|13|You can see how he made his money.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_112.wav|45|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_061.wav|5|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_081.wav|28|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_215.wav|49|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_199.wav|41|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_346.wav|9|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_225.wav|21|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_338.wav|75|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_295.wav|11|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_146.wav|85|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_055.wav|63|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_338.wav|34|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_238.wav|73|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_206.wav|11|They have to be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_083.wav|92|I had found my vision.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_319.wav|9|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_227.wav|58|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_118.wav|0|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_110.wav|99|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_265.wav|82|That will not change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_024.wav|57|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_282.wav|83|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_187.wav|78|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_320.wav|86|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_294.wav|95|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_169.wav|12|Who do these people think they are?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_381.wav|23|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_391.wav|46|There was no energy behind it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_014.wav|35|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_218.wav|33|The problem is worse in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_198.wav|102|Both of them have looked good.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_164.wav|47|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_139.wav|20|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_250.wav|84|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_264.wav|20|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_178.wav|80|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_233.wav|49|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_414.wav|19|We never agreed to it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_319.wav|48|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_381.wav|94|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_138.wav|104|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_106.wav|5|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_467.wav|95|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_406.wav|106|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_267.wav|75|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_058.wav|98|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_103.wav|4|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_048.wav|107|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_413.wav|105|We are delighted with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_298.wav|101|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_116.wav|90|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_041.wav|87|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_398.wav|97|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_062.wav|40|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_407.wav|4|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_293.wav|82|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_336.wav|75|That decision has already been made.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_014.wav|42|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_028.wav|5|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_246.wav|65|It is based on population rather than need.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_030.wav|49|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_153.wav|24|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_050.wav|46|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_263.wav|2|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_243.wav|83|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_310.wav|95|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_285.wav|87|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_166.wav|9|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_347.wav|79|This is still happening in the US.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_229.wav|6|Well, we know now.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_227.wav|39|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_134.wav|16|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_303.wav|33|He then did just that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_422.wav|49|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_330.wav|50|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_232.wav|13|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_321.wav|45|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_027.wav|48|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_377.wav|79|What do we have to do?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_163.wav|45|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_409.wav|14|The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_031.wav|87|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_343.wav|56|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_126.wav|85|You can see the appeal of running away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_115.wav|70|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_021.wav|8|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_303.wav|45|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_063.wav|61|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_044.wav|24|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_132.wav|56|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_169.wav|98|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_087.wav|86|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_208.wav|14|This will take several weeks.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_184.wav|97|The police were called in.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_112.wav|10|They almost achieved a draw.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_049.wav|47|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_146.wav|30|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_338.wav|86|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_367.wav|99|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_184.wav|3|They were not seeking the right to strike.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_055.wav|33|There was mystery back then.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_307.wav|91|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_053.wav|31|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_331.wav|106|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_334.wav|9|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_271.wav|32|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_305.wav|6|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_109.wav|12|There are some new buildings in there.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_375.wav|34|But the fans deserve to know!
DUMMY2/p239/p239_059.wav|48|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_345.wav|20|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_134.wav|89|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_120.wav|51|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_447.wav|50|We've got a good management record.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_028.wav|6|The proposals were not new.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_413.wav|62|He will never walk the streets again.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_347.wav|58|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_253.wav|9|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_398.wav|66|We've still got a say in this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_336.wav|39|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_234.wav|27|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_220.wav|107|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_217.wav|61|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_176.wav|34|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_055.wav|84|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_288.wav|32|They can leave at any time.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_305.wav|35|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_251.wav|67|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_176.wav|36|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_032.wav|89|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_222.wav|44|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_035.wav|22|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_158.wav|32|Scotland came very close in the second Test.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_019.wav|94|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_403.wav|13|I knew she was going to win.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_286.wav|72|I played badly, but it happens.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_156.wav|81|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_196.wav|44|I don't know exactly what happened.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_206.wav|69|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_146.wav|25|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_266.wav|107|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_465.wav|95|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_021.wav|94|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_151.wav|6|They will not be going back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_055.wav|71|"We were surprised to see the photograph."
DUMMY2/p310/p310_372.wav|17|In fact it isn't related to either.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_394.wav|11|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_134.wav|5|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_181.wav|52|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_248.wav|88|It was something special.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_108.wav|67|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_313.wav|30|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_073.wav|102|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_119.wav|39|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_002.wav|72|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_083.wav|31|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_066.wav|37|It's the performance we want.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_041.wav|89|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_185.wav|84|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_360.wav|42|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_393.wav|54|For some, it was more painful than others.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_027.wav|60|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_220.wav|75|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_382.wav|55|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_129.wav|31|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_209.wav|66|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_031.wav|37|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_036.wav|8|He really is a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_156.wav|22|But you can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_355.wav|57|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_389.wav|22|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_167.wav|19|It will not be easy for him.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_403.wav|75|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_123.wav|40|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_085.wav|24|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_464.wav|14|I'm very passionate about my country.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_236.wav|89|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_492.wav|48|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_020.wav|61|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_105.wav|63|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_356.wav|27|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_238.wav|27|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_309.wav|51|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_150.wav|12|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_313.wav|83|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_368.wav|76|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_423.wav|92|The document is a starting point for discussion.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_116.wav|96|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_031.wav|45|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_264.wav|38|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_135.wav|9|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_177.wav|34|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_071.wav|60|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_173.wav|81|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_162.wav|5|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_205.wav|51|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_320.wav|26|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_165.wav|33|It is not an escape.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_057.wav|68|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_057.wav|24|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_214.wav|23|The replacements made a big difference.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_208.wav|80|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_257.wav|59|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_401.wav|72|We need to tighten up.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_146.wav|7|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_367.wav|56|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_172.wav|37|We continue to hold the shares.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_097.wav|75|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_365.wav|0|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_169.wav|24|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_424.wav|104|He died at the hands of his captors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_259.wav|13|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_019.wav|35|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_305.wav|91|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_331.wav|46|I am not changing my event.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_125.wav|87|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_135.wav|95|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_368.wav|85|It wasn't an easy decision.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_349.wav|106|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_180.wav|14|They could not match it.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_173.wav|22|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_105.wav|54|T, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_323.wav|25|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_223.wav|27|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_414.wav|34|Now it's all written down.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_407.wav|64|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_056.wav|9|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_222.wav|55|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_092.wav|44|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_106.wav|69|Our position remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_199.wav|31|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_113.wav|0|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_169.wav|40|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_388.wav|28|That is difficult to answer.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_136.wav|91|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_071.wav|20|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_012.wav|67|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_294.wav|78|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_158.wav|31|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_173.wav|23|I am very shocked.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_197.wav|69|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_403.wav|33|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_191.wav|55|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_351.wav|2|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_017.wav|99|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_268.wav|65|I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_252.wav|32|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_148.wav|34|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_181.wav|59|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_115.wav|30|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_026.wav|55|This would include insurance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_183.wav|58|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_192.wav|37|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_139.wav|69|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_331.wav|24|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_142.wav|16|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_131.wav|82|It certainly should not be used too often.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_194.wav|52|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_190.wav|69|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_187.wav|88|The matter has been reported to the police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_057.wav|88|Partly, it is his own fault.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_129.wav|102|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_187.wav|76|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_232.wav|94|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_070.wav|11|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_057.wav|90|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_081.wav|103|I was there for five hours.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_063.wav|53|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_056.wav|91|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_046.wav|38|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_323.wav|79|Not that he was complaining.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_376.wav|58|We have been working together for some years.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_140.wav|35|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_114.wav|99|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_302.wav|19|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_103.wav|58|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_014.wav|21|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_346.wav|42|It was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_354.wav|96|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_094.wav|73|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_045.wav|92|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_176.wav|32|Says the Duke of York.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_203.wav|97|Mr Smith was dismissive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_157.wav|78|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_052.wav|92|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_283.wav|55|It is a dangerous sport.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_282.wav|68|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_086.wav|44|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_312.wav|11|There was a hell of a row.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_314.wav|80|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_399.wav|17|The issue has still to be resolved.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_020.wav|73|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_215.wav|86|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_206.wav|52|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_103.wav|1|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_235.wav|101|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_082.wav|68|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_086.wav|61|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_267.wav|3|We can certainly build on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_369.wav|32|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_172.wav|83|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_323.wav|50|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_241.wav|14|She was an only child.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_144.wav|76|They played it like a cup final.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_272.wav|44|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_081.wav|49|That would be dangerous.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_303.wav|21|It is a real concern.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_144.wav|84|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_198.wav|66|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_222.wav|86|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_047.wav|85|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_228.wav|42|I will let you in on a secret.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_396.wav|0|I watch the other visitors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_073.wav|67|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_312.wav|73|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_084.wav|100|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_013.wav|64|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_181.wav|69|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_320.wav|16|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_045.wav|32|I had come back from London.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_058.wav|83|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_203.wav|13|It has affected me.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_161.wav|48|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_229.wav|60|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_034.wav|76|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_132.wav|45|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_375.wav|102|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_172.wav|36|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_332.wav|24|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_334.wav|51|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_033.wav|6|He gave no other details.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_219.wav|52|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_426.wav|63|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_154.wav|2|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_004.wav|85|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_263.wav|83|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_399.wav|55|It was too difficult.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_173.wav|70|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_128.wav|23|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_421.wav|27|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_019.wav|49|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_390.wav|58|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_209.wav|106|It is quite a thing to watch.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_191.wav|48|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_344.wav|72|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_212.wav|51|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_416.wav|16|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_349.wav|68|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_324.wav|40|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_339.wav|62|He had a horror.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_058.wav|35|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_073.wav|54|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_259.wav|86|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_280.wav|58|We need to be looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_009.wav|75|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_304.wav|97|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_047.wav|1|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_175.wav|23|When will this change?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_307.wav|51|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_242.wav|17|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_044.wav|77|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_047.wav|25|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_055.wav|95|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_084.wav|29|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_415.wav|96|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_422.wav|8|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_361.wav|72|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_046.wav|95|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_209.wav|26|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_207.wav|20|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_091.wav|25|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_343.wav|6|Therefore there is a threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_343.wav|27|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_062.wav|36|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_051.wav|104|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_146.wav|68|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_193.wav|89|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_066.wav|24|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_343.wav|99|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_073.wav|30|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_277.wav|3|That would be a danger.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_144.wav|18|He was part of the family.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_172.wav|46|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_401.wav|39|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_238.wav|79|Neil is never going to come back.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_154.wav|94|It's like a football team.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_168.wav|67|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_175.wav|74|It was very close.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_266.wav|76|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_003.wav|29|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_256.wav|6|All winners should be tested.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_268.wav|89|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_242.wav|25|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_182.wav|69|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_372.wav|103|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_064.wav|102|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_123.wav|6|Motorists will welcome this.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_173.wav|3|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_301.wav|23|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_052.wav|60|That's a concern to me.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_116.wav|88|It's an old story.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_096.wav|23|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_422.wav|7|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_098.wav|54|Are they control freaks?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_203.wav|26|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_116.wav|81|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_345.wav|1|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_321.wav|40|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_162.wav|12|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_184.wav|5|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_100.wav|93|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_114.wav|102|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_116.wav|49|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_197.wav|57|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_123.wav|27|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_198.wav|6|I don't think it's the area.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_321.wav|54|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_399.wav|35|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_213.wav|21|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_281.wav|15|It takes a bit of working out.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_175.wav|68|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_094.wav|34|He was not able to talk to us.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_149.wav|26|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_268.wav|77|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_037.wav|97|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_345.wav|65|I believe they are dead.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_185.wav|35|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_258.wav|31|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_102.wav|0|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_053.wav|75|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_205.wav|19|So she told him.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_202.wav|68|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_170.wav|50|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_103.wav|73|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_053.wav|88|I can live with that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_011.wav|105|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_246.wav|17|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_149.wav|48|I was given no instructions by no-one.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_066.wav|47|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_258.wav|48|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_123.wav|31|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_067.wav|22|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_390.wav|54|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_161.wav|104|There is no shortage of commitment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_210.wav|96|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_255.wav|14|Mr Smith declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_265.wav|58|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_119.wav|83|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_230.wav|68|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_145.wav|43|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_267.wav|102|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_007.wav|96|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_047.wav|59|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_401.wav|0|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_141.wav|8|I feel very grateful with everything.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_291.wav|44|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_406.wav|107|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_394.wav|23|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_315.wav|5|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_023.wav|65|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p312/p312_311.wav|62|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_279.wav|83|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_030.wav|28|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_169.wav|22|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_254.wav|46|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_186.wav|0|A terrorist is a terrorist.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_087.wav|45|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_139.wav|90|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_198.wav|31|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_065.wav|32|Then followed a bout of flu.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_084.wav|47|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_292.wav|71|"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_133.wav|41|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_407.wav|22|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_419.wav|1|This is about the Orange Order.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_389.wav|72|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_050.wav|90|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_054.wav|92|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
DUMMY2/p250/p250_348.wav|24|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_103.wav|67|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_212.wav|31|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_194.wav|107|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_326.wav|4|I was in tears in the street.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_108.wav|81|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_296.wav|86|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_141.wav|56|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_135.wav|0|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_208.wav|59|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_276.wav|31|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_159.wav|75|It's not like us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_363.wav|28|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_344.wav|66|We have to go for it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_035.wav|23|There is a lot of heroin about.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_221.wav|105|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_350.wav|105|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_247.wav|85|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_250.wav|86|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_306.wav|66|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_311.wav|94|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_345.wav|59|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_087.wav|32|Tony Blair said as little.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_383.wav|13|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_318.wav|10|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_350.wav|39|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_066.wav|95|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_353.wav|31|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_235.wav|81|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_374.wav|69|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_267.wav|4|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_125.wav|81|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_385.wav|50|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_404.wav|54|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_163.wav|73|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_088.wav|72|So is there anything left to say?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_083.wav|48|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_003.wav|35|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_384.wav|37|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_266.wav|43|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_355.wav|107|It was a UK-wide report.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_151.wav|73|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_415.wav|35|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_187.wav|41|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_038.wav|52|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_121.wav|8|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_223.wav|101|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_353.wav|91|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_029.wav|106|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_302.wav|75|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_327.wav|31|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_165.wav|28|We all have to look in the mirror.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_252.wav|71|"This court has made an order which has not been observed."
DUMMY2/p313/p313_072.wav|76|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_029.wav|6|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_317.wav|79|The concerns were unfounded.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_402.wav|104|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_020.wav|30|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_366.wav|63|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_331.wav|95|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_070.wav|74|If only it were so.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_019.wav|27|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_229.wav|44|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_419.wav|100|But a surprise is in store.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_202.wav|90|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_222.wav|47|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_333.wav|16|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_297.wav|4|I seem to keep this for the majors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_218.wav|63|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_092.wav|3|They have a further report to make in March.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_030.wav|2|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_146.wav|74|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_221.wav|46|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_289.wav|92|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_242.wav|8|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_058.wav|18|We need to do that every week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_163.wav|97|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_219.wav|5|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_038.wav|49|Who does he think will win?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_190.wav|37|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_262.wav|39|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_329.wav|58|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_340.wav|102|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_349.wav|37|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_215.wav|31|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_177.wav|33|It was really frustrating.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_332.wav|85|It will not work in our favour.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_275.wav|55|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_131.wav|71|"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_204.wav|35|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_142.wav|38|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_003.wav|58|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_342.wav|48|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_397.wav|72|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_288.wav|43|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_338.wav|67|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_363.wav|54|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_226.wav|37|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_226.wav|73|Wealth is relative.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_360.wav|65|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_070.wav|16|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_177.wav|75|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_384.wav|41|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_408.wav|35|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_168.wav|96|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_165.wav|30|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_023.wav|53|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_404.wav|4|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_089.wav|63|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_454.wav|32|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_006.wav|59|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_121.wav|77|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_035.wav|33|We have to win every game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_375.wav|103|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_217.wav|79|It just could be a good night.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_268.wav|105|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_080.wav|68|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_189.wav|33|I am just grateful he is alive.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_275.wav|54|I am now just a bit uneasy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_098.wav|29|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_039.wav|46|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_046.wav|65|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_136.wav|9|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_030.wav|85|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_349.wav|13|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_054.wav|106|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_305.wav|66|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_137.wav|64|All the people thought that he would die.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_198.wav|70|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_256.wav|91|Wagner was never like this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_376.wav|105|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_134.wav|18|He will be a major challenger next year.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_216.wav|98|There's nothing to be gained by it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_167.wav|49|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_150.wav|13|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_309.wav|22|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_160.wav|44|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_290.wav|85|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_451.wav|8|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_167.wav|54|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_413.wav|39|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_090.wav|62|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_320.wav|37|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_024.wav|62|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_170.wav|60|I have a good feeling about this.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_215.wav|6|We can all understand that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_020.wav|20|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_278.wav|96|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_026.wav|73|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_044.wav|46|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_255.wav|67|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_299.wav|17|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_324.wav|66|Instead, she just went away.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_262.wav|24|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_144.wav|28|I've grown up a bit.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_318.wav|51|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_226.wav|2|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_397.wav|25|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_090.wav|29|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_146.wav|26|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_251.wav|1|We must all play our part.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_334.wav|83|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_140.wav|33|I think we can overcome it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_254.wav|105|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_277.wav|69|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_299.wav|105|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_310.wav|60|I've been waiting a long time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_060.wav|58|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_324.wav|101|There is no plan B.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_043.wav|30|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_052.wav|75|That was the difference today.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_339.wav|60|You can't get the experience in Austria.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_235.wav|97|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_119.wav|103|Both offices were closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_206.wav|59|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_149.wav|5|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_211.wav|12|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_347.wav|42|We certainly hope we have been successful.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_245.wav|77|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_093.wav|2|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_344.wav|74|They said they would.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_033.wav|102|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_240.wav|68|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_181.wav|14|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_248.wav|102|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_277.wav|6|He is certainly not looking for another job.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_259.wav|48|We have expanded too quickly.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_180.wav|8|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_107.wav|97|This is not a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_174.wav|102|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_312.wav|98|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_390.wav|38|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_384.wav|49|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_261.wav|54|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_098.wav|6|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_308.wav|24|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_240.wav|71|"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_370.wav|84|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_205.wav|69|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_320.wav|91|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_095.wav|28|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_362.wav|38|She was released from hospital yesterday.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_323.wav|91|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_153.wav|1|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_160.wav|80|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_385.wav|33|It's a fantastic achievement.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_003.wav|85|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_340.wav|105|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_386.wav|69|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_330.wav|36|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_058.wav|46|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_300.wav|104|There was no happiness.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_155.wav|11|I have been there already.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_264.wav|72|Had she enjoyed the experience?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_381.wav|55|An appeal was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_177.wav|105|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_143.wav|26|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_280.wav|32|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_002.wav|27|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_079.wav|67|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_225.wav|12|And that gives a kind of freedom.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_131.wav|80|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_166.wav|81|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_309.wav|23|That suggests that out fitness is good.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_358.wav|19|Closure is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_115.wav|82|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_119.wav|41|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_037.wav|102|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_376.wav|42|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_045.wav|17|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_194.wav|78|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_258.wav|72|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_268.wav|5|We are happy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_020.wav|7|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p287/p287_107.wav|77|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_115.wav|99|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_133.wav|1|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_327.wav|85|His art was not just about emotions.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_038.wav|79|And this was well known?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_405.wav|66|You have to have some hope and faith.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_382.wav|82|Or is it?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_351.wav|63|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_255.wav|55|It had happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_052.wav|57|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_162.wav|31|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_338.wav|64|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_007.wav|88|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_083.wav|50|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_211.wav|61|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_350.wav|82|I am very happy.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_492.wav|65|New York is my home.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_405.wav|10|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_415.wav|1|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_143.wav|94|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_197.wav|7|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_116.wav|89|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_053.wav|99|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_199.wav|56|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_386.wav|17|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_187.wav|5|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_306.wav|19|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_390.wav|91|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_132.wav|85|Now, however, things are different.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_083.wav|69|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_199.wav|45|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_197.wav|49|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_185.wav|95|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_052.wav|85|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_398.wav|96|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_175.wav|14|The strong performance is expected to continue.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_164.wav|4|He changed my life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_077.wav|64|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_359.wav|27|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_186.wav|85|What is so unusual about this case?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_215.wav|43|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_233.wav|41|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_136.wav|21|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_089.wav|15|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_286.wav|100|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_022.wav|12|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_121.wav|90|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_087.wav|9|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_203.wav|70|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_387.wav|34|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_102.wav|19|There was no trouble at all.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_380.wav|97|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_420.wav|6|Both were reduced to rubble.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_302.wav|3|But it was also hard.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_293.wav|41|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_118.wav|77|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_378.wav|77|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_253.wav|46|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_402.wav|107|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_339.wav|15|Doesn't matter what you do.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_135.wav|39|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_109.wav|104|That was the context of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_058.wav|43|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_416.wav|42|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_271.wav|68|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_348.wav|87|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_254.wav|32|Is our children learning ?)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_040.wav|74|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_207.wav|74|It wouldn't matter if he had.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_375.wav|23|The whole experience has left me bitter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_367.wav|11|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_286.wav|65|The institute board will take the decision.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_153.wav|88|I don't think it is the case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_200.wav|26|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_093.wav|36|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_226.wav|8|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_012.wav|55|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_009.wav|102|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_037.wav|15|It's not Big Brother at sea.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_070.wav|90|They are real.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_241.wav|53|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_445.wav|100|The first game is so important.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_372.wav|27|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_363.wav|65|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_036.wav|65|Certainly, we do as well.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_008.wav|45|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_042.wav|31|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_215.wav|12|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_123.wav|76|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_168.wav|106|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_269.wav|12|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_051.wav|45|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_030.wav|99|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_221.wav|101|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_088.wav|30|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_332.wav|56|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_030.wav|82|The Farmer is called an idiot.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_418.wav|22|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_165.wav|38|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_184.wav|11|But it did not last.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_366.wav|28|Finally action had been taken.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_386.wav|28|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_320.wav|4|We'll see what happens.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_341.wav|12|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_044.wav|79|I'm sure he does.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_126.wav|20|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_145.wav|4|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
DUMMY2/p286/p286_315.wav|63|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_208.wav|38|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_306.wav|61|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_151.wav|2|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_168.wav|30|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_143.wav|23|The proposals were never taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_373.wav|10|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_196.wav|101|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_160.wav|52|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_388.wav|60|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_124.wav|12|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_281.wav|21|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_004.wav|37|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_309.wav|57|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_040.wav|19|They hit me in the head.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_209.wav|102|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_412.wav|27|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_024.wav|11|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_240.wav|57|She was well balanced.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_120.wav|71|"She really suffered for her art."
DUMMY2/p268/p268_137.wav|87|All the employees are redundant.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_303.wav|10|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_215.wav|97|They do the work, you know.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_300.wav|65|That was around July, August.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_135.wav|76|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_208.wav|87|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_040.wav|69|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_488.wav|65|Just look at his fashion sense.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_185.wav|40|His name was unknown.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_111.wav|100|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_186.wav|35|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_121.wav|56|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_106.wav|65|You're quite wrong, he said.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_147.wav|58|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_270.wav|89|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_442.wav|7|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_134.wav|76|At some point, the bill will be presented.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_085.wav|14|Even the one she loved.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_429.wav|7|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_035.wav|54|Everyone around the club was supportive.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_150.wav|49|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_320.wav|28|He is involved in everything.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_134.wav|3|It is not so simple.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_042.wav|86|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_110.wav|8|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_131.wav|63|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_145.wav|106|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_071.wav|66|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_040.wav|29|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_350.wav|35|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_137.wav|16|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_297.wav|7|I felt about this big.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_156.wav|82|But the damage had been done.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_258.wav|6|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_020.wav|83|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_249.wav|65|I did not vote either way.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_167.wav|64|I am very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_212.wav|38|But who cares?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_165.wav|98|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_270.wav|58|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_073.wav|43|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_080.wav|21|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_155.wav|73|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_368.wav|36|The major championships will always have a special place.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_090.wav|87|I am glad I wasn't in it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_012.wav|43|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_165.wav|7|Behind him was his brother.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_123.wav|96|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_293.wav|86|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_243.wav|98|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_292.wav|23|We told them in June.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_207.wav|2|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_398.wav|107|It was nerve-racking to watch.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_305.wav|36|There should be room for creative dissent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_247.wav|60|It's up to the defence team.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_072.wav|14|You should try to have a laugh.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_365.wav|52|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_027.wav|89|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_143.wav|4|We've not won anything yet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_108.wav|78|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_222.wav|78|He was not injured in the attack.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_175.wav|98|About time too, you might think.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_221.wav|83|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_347.wav|99|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_085.wav|87|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_320.wav|34|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_141.wav|46|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_129.wav|95|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_250.wav|77|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_279.wav|22|There is no substitute.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_289.wav|100|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_336.wav|82|I just want to do the good work.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_069.wav|72|We have avoided that at least.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_081.wav|5|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_017.wav|25|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_138.wav|12|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_257.wav|62|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_389.wav|28|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_181.wav|74|And that's it?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_158.wav|84|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_414.wav|40|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_057.wav|33|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_228.wav|14|The transaction is not feasible.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_092.wav|86|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_004.wav|5|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_166.wav|55|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_236.wav|65|Has the conflict started?)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_183.wav|34|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_166.wav|59|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_110.wav|64|It needs somebody to give way.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_386.wav|48|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_355.wav|16|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_226.wav|71|"They had no children."
DUMMY2/p270/p270_046.wav|8|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_361.wav|93|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_401.wav|14|It proved a good decision.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_354.wav|36|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_164.wav|32|But it is different in different regions.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_389.wav|38|Would you take them?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_337.wav|84|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_367.wav|102|They are also exploited by the markets.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_217.wav|23|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_257.wav|46|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_420.wav|27|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_281.wav|101|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_330.wav|79|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_106.wav|21|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_015.wav|85|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_077.wav|51|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_323.wav|89|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_199.wav|27|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_249.wav|32|The effects are not all bad.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_067.wav|107|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_008.wav|8|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_372.wav|29|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_087.wav|13|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_213.wav|22|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_383.wav|28|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_141.wav|92|I got very, very tired.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_210.wav|39|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_092.wav|24|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_103.wav|86|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_214.wav|69|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_366.wav|68|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_354.wav|77|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_393.wav|58|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_408.wav|97|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_237.wav|65|Have I really come to this?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_422.wav|15|He got the part.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_027.wav|17|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_129.wav|60|We have a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_404.wav|69|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_291.wav|73|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_082.wav|103|But then he changed his mind.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_071.wav|95|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_205.wav|7|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_166.wav|88|Now they have to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_052.wav|70|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_278.wav|77|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_324.wav|107|They would be wise to do just that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_032.wav|91|The punishment was swift.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_272.wav|83|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_313.wav|20|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_422.wav|34|I wish it well.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_177.wav|98|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_239.wav|9|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_353.wav|77|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_043.wav|77|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_217.wav|37|I will not take part in Edmonton.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_402.wav|105|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_321.wav|37|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_035.wav|35|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_250.wav|28|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_044.wav|103|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_344.wav|12|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_149.wav|88|It's a good story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_239.wav|34|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_249.wav|88|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_154.wav|52|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_227.wav|13|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_233.wav|72|I'm really excited about the album.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_012.wav|31|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_143.wav|90|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_395.wav|51|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_028.wav|10|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_226.wav|78|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_389.wav|35|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_121.wav|21|This decision is destroying my family.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_365.wav|62|Is it a warning to parents?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_294.wav|9|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_007.wav|66|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_188.wav|44|Glasgow then took control.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_116.wav|4|I find it rather oppressive.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_297.wav|27|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_238.wav|32|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_053.wav|10|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_283.wav|37|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_181.wav|75|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_032.wav|15|I have a very strong opinion about this.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_262.wav|90|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_135.wav|57|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_255.wav|92|When we started the album.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_211.wav|37|But experts have disputed that statistic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_090.wav|1|Everything has the potential to be serious.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_348.wav|40|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_177.wav|16|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_279.wav|60|Those were the days.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_390.wav|95|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_396.wav|85|They are taking a stand against this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_067.wav|59|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_249.wav|85|We're just waiting for her reaction.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_123.wav|90|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_135.wav|47|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_072.wav|86|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_299.wav|44|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_097.wav|89|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_038.wav|88|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_266.wav|62|You are a liar.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_096.wav|1|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_203.wav|33|It makes a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_312.wav|96|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_344.wav|0|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_164.wav|102|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_029.wav|84|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_188.wav|40|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_255.wav|39|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_200.wav|57|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_108.wav|32|Here the jury is still out.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_111.wav|19|It's just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_161.wav|77|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_119.wav|60|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_065.wav|70|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_010.wav|23|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_195.wav|74|However, that is a sizeable if.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_059.wav|55|Or so he thought.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_010.wav|43|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_181.wav|37|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_212.wav|58|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_302.wav|96|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_353.wav|76|He was made redundant in February of last year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_248.wav|22|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_343.wav|96|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_248.wav|23|But one shouldn't go by that.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_372.wav|96|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_131.wav|0|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_401.wav|78|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_182.wav|104|A decision is expected in September.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_315.wav|94|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_219.wav|17|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_333.wav|7|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_312.wav|59|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_153.wav|75|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_247.wav|100|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_188.wav|25|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_130.wav|103|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_182.wav|56|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_066.wav|29|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_346.wav|21|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_059.wav|31|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_189.wav|68|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_051.wav|17|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_257.wav|52|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_300.wav|39|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_231.wav|38|He is adamant that he is innocent.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_339.wav|2|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_148.wav|44|All kinds of things occur.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_278.wav|68|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_321.wav|2|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_394.wav|42|I ran to get out of the way.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_235.wav|2|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_345.wav|72|Things start to talk to each other.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_125.wav|72|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_053.wav|50|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_045.wav|90|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_372.wav|104|But opponents were quick to criticise.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_026.wav|68|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_032.wav|41|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_023.wav|17|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_485.wav|48|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_391.wav|15|He can win every week.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_127.wav|46|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_274.wav|55|The long-term trend is equally clear.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_286.wav|76|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_220.wav|16|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_416.wav|6|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_284.wav|10|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_243.wav|25|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_277.wav|21|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_227.wav|25|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_382.wav|77|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_106.wav|1|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_284.wav|104|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_239.wav|98|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_172.wav|75|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_144.wav|72|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_081.wav|102|His options are severely limited.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_260.wav|12|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_136.wav|56|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_279.wav|106|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_218.wav|82|But we are losing that connection.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_252.wav|37|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_177.wav|74|It gives us hope.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_186.wav|90|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_421.wav|34|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_323.wav|44|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_146.wav|65|Mr Dewar understood that.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_006.wav|2|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_350.wav|70|That would help.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_113.wav|97|The company has other problems with the shells.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_213.wav|105|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_453.wav|100|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_212.wav|70|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_323.wav|99|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_287.wav|81|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p241/p241_294.wav|86|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_204.wav|69|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_256.wav|16|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_376.wav|46|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_116.wav|77|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_190.wav|40|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_310.wav|91|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_303.wav|74|I've heard it all before.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_145.wav|28|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_120.wav|29|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_178.wav|55|All options are available.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_259.wav|64|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_098.wav|25|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p295/p295_147.wav|92|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_149.wav|64|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_196.wav|50|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_059.wav|3|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_179.wav|58|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_326.wav|3|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_126.wav|69|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_069.wav|4|I have a choice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_411.wav|104|It raises the edge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_143.wav|63|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_138.wav|92|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_410.wav|38|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_092.wav|54|He had done his homework properly.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_387.wav|69|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_303.wav|19|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_261.wav|105|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_210.wav|24|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_045.wav|73|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_263.wav|58|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_263.wav|37|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_165.wav|80|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_028.wav|35|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_146.wav|51|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_346.wav|31|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_008.wav|89|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_386.wav|46|Is that where we are?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_060.wav|100|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_150.wav|67|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_017.wav|54|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_270.wav|23|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_027.wav|47|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_424.wav|106|The might be rolled out.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_199.wav|105|IT S all in the hair.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_415.wav|104|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_098.wav|62|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_125.wav|36|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_242.wav|40|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_363.wav|101|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_385.wav|98|We were beaten by the better team today.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_260.wav|11|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_028.wav|17|It feels like a winner already.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_048.wav|12|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_444.wav|8|It shows the right amount of progress.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_252.wav|102|I just saw them for a few minutes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_351.wav|23|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_150.wav|58|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_028.wav|58|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_432.wav|105|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_078.wav|16|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_292.wav|63|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_236.wav|47|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_318.wav|85|The police believe that the man was not injured.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_351.wav|52|I think we are back on track.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_408.wav|42|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_403.wav|103|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_316.wav|100|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_038.wav|22|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_351.wav|67|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_272.wav|85|I should have given him one in return.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_028.wav|103|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_451.wav|27|It was ignored.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_227.wav|37|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_279.wav|98|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_153.wav|95|It will be retained as part of the group.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_033.wav|29|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_225.wav|105|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_373.wav|84|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_114.wav|79|They have to tell it as it is.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_202.wav|54|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_073.wav|70|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_293.wav|19|This year, it was a little different.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_410.wav|22|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_326.wav|87|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_121.wav|74|Johnsen is equally concerned.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_385.wav|65|His third child was born in April.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_494.wav|24|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_170.wav|18|The goal is clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_283.wav|103|We are taking it seriously.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_222.wav|23|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_381.wav|15|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_396.wav|58|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_129.wav|25|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_362.wav|94|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_326.wav|5|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_077.wav|14|I was as strong as a horse.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_166.wav|91|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_167.wav|73|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_295.wav|59|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_306.wav|11|But it has all been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_274.wav|14|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_100.wav|17|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_359.wav|29|I am very interested in the subject.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_108.wav|85|I did not have faith in the procedures.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_053.wav|90|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_295.wav|55|Kenny and I are ready.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_062.wav|49|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_234.wav|92|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_082.wav|2|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_144.wav|82|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_377.wav|36|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_197.wav|12|We have only nine months to go.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_022.wav|98|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_051.wav|60|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_413.wav|79|That can benefit the larger companies.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_205.wav|90|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_194.wav|44|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_289.wav|57|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_300.wav|63|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_098.wav|82|However, his involvement was instant.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_031.wav|105|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_246.wav|47|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_319.wav|77|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_255.wav|105|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_149.wav|91|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_094.wav|44|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_172.wav|39|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_047.wav|48|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_091.wav|34|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_086.wav|89|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_137.wav|21|All the pressure will be on him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_126.wav|100|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_133.wav|102|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_173.wav|102|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_184.wav|27|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_383.wav|107|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_012.wav|98|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_393.wav|51|There must be boundaries.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_319.wav|83|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_151.wav|25|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_133.wav|63|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_026.wav|14|Meetings will also remain private.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_319.wav|1|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_385.wav|40|It can help.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_045.wav|46|How many cases have there been?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_359.wav|67|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_270.wav|59|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_084.wav|75|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_163.wav|14|He's not a Celtic man.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_026.wav|96|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_244.wav|52|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_277.wav|97|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_064.wav|103|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_042.wav|99|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_393.wav|78|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_320.wav|85|There was too much at stake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_252.wav|51|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_097.wav|62|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_322.wav|26|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_261.wav|20|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_162.wav|13|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_378.wav|96|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_208.wav|83|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_161.wav|84|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_149.wav|28|Our position is clear.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_268.wav|91|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_066.wav|57|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_253.wav|2|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_301.wav|20|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_057.wav|93|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_265.wav|2|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_031.wav|16|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_335.wav|61|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_167.wav|18|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_376.wav|37|I have little time for analysts.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_360.wav|40|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_158.wav|38|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_174.wav|72|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_291.wav|106|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_243.wav|50|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_264.wav|22|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_304.wav|76|I'm not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_333.wav|106|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_370.wav|37|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_175.wav|10|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_179.wav|76|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_241.wav|9|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_378.wav|45|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_175.wav|6|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_369.wav|76|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_247.wav|72|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_035.wav|18|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_069.wav|55|It would have to be.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_261.wav|25|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_197.wav|95|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_252.wav|29|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_151.wav|37|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_241.wav|57|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_195.wav|88|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_158.wav|95|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_387.wav|2|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_039.wav|10|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_372.wav|62|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_099.wav|66|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_104.wav|106|Context is also very important.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_334.wav|56|Nobody said it was required.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_028.wav|70|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_346.wav|72|I would like to stay with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_267.wav|87|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_092.wav|76|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_051.wav|53|I'm as fit as I can get.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_099.wav|15|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_148.wav|81|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_268.wav|25|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_015.wav|97|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_356.wav|24|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_137.wav|74|This research is extremely promising.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_053.wav|21|This was never a support group.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_036.wav|69|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_119.wav|37|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_180.wav|1|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_205.wav|21|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_242.wav|61|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_191.wav|12|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_150.wav|20|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_423.wav|76|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_038.wav|4|That's what we're still trying to do.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_236.wav|67|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_006.wav|75|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_022.wav|89|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_167.wav|91|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_152.wav|80|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_046.wav|97|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_103.wav|28|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_342.wav|53|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_158.wav|74|He was as good as his word.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_447.wav|89|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_146.wav|42|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_305.wav|61|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_030.wav|12|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_133.wav|64|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_266.wav|3|Not in this production he doesn't.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_125.wav|82|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_207.wav|4|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_076.wav|79|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_156.wav|68|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_280.wav|107|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_021.wav|75|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_350.wav|9|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_337.wav|80|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_089.wav|61|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_328.wav|97|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_469.wav|24|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_404.wav|0|You thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_029.wav|101|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_021.wav|61|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_108.wav|25|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_080.wav|1|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_187.wav|100|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_331.wav|43|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_091.wav|82|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_090.wav|85|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_298.wav|106|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_172.wav|25|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_202.wav|13|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_442.wav|32|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_024.wav|75|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_015.wav|44|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_180.wav|72|They've got to decide to do that.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_153.wav|19|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_072.wav|1|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_040.wav|52|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_130.wav|25|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_211.wav|44|Many, many people don't know who he is.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_059.wav|99|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_170.wav|107|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_046.wav|7|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_113.wav|36|Or it would have been.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_155.wav|2|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_330.wav|99|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_044.wav|84|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_125.wav|30|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_068.wav|83|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_171.wav|56|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_231.wav|82|We have all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_182.wav|63|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_276.wav|22|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_375.wav|82|Suddenly, there was an audience.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_127.wav|49|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_164.wav|64|There are no charges.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_211.wav|1|The cold war is over.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_200.wav|89|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_290.wav|68|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_016.wav|105|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_213.wav|52|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_160.wav|55|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_232.wav|9|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_282.wav|76|I'm confident we can do that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_203.wav|78|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_157.wav|95|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_383.wav|41|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_292.wav|66|The whole team was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_011.wav|27|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_064.wav|16|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_091.wav|98|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_252.wav|6|Then one day it happened.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_248.wav|53|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_068.wav|88|I see no need to change.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_407.wav|14|There was an element of frustration.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_309.wav|50|He is still in shock.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_170.wav|0|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_062.wav|9|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_313.wav|65|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_213.wav|76|The squad will be the same for France.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_394.wav|65|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_010.wav|69|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_381.wav|36|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_050.wav|93|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_267.wav|23|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_332.wav|37|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_098.wav|96|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_134.wav|17|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_010.wav|59|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_274.wav|51|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_403.wav|107|It's a very high number.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_206.wav|25|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_259.wav|11|The court has not decided.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_407.wav|18|It is an investment in our product.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_370.wav|7|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_347.wav|25|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_160.wav|0|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_302.wav|68|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_102.wav|24|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_236.wav|38|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_113.wav|104|I don't know the nature of the illness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_168.wav|26|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_245.wav|81|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_026.wav|23|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_153.wav|20|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_261.wav|62|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_213.wav|3|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_321.wav|1|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_237.wav|60|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_161.wav|13|It is about the script for me.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_021.wav|6|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_403.wav|27|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_117.wav|91|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_428.wav|75|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_144.wav|106|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_328.wav|73|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_136.wav|76|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_296.wav|78|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_119.wav|5|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_269.wav|89|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_382.wav|62|The urgency is real.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_081.wav|71|"No progress has been made."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_369.wav|50|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_265.wav|9|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_152.wav|28|Then in came a succession of signings.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_094.wav|40|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_033.wav|61|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_393.wav|14|It has happened for generations.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_130.wav|22|We need to move forward together.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_048.wav|41|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_240.wav|55|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_140.wav|58|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_471.wav|24|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_328.wav|77|It wasn't a good day for us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_316.wav|43|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_452.wav|75|It is a cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_262.wav|68|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_360.wav|78|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_003.wav|59|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_045.wav|84|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_138.wav|100|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_326.wav|29|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_329.wav|11|This is great news for us.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_288.wav|86|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_400.wav|60|That is the difference.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_329.wav|59|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_220.wav|12|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_313.wav|7|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_008.wav|61|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_095.wav|71|"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights."
DUMMY2/p269/p269_349.wav|94|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_031.wav|33|He added, We have the same desire.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_289.wav|37|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_333.wav|52|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_202.wav|95|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_418.wav|20|That may be.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_316.wav|24|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_370.wav|76|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_242.wav|69|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_120.wav|8|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_382.wav|72|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_179.wav|13|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_290.wav|60|That is the key.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_298.wav|89|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_242.wav|6|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_322.wav|46|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_023.wav|94|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_350.wav|29|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_418.wav|6|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_391.wav|95|It would be quite nice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_233.wav|55|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_324.wav|16|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_153.wav|93|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_177.wav|25|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_013.wav|28|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_378.wav|14|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_380.wav|98|It runs in cycles.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_149.wav|0|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_410.wav|95|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_407.wav|35|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_424.wav|92|There is still the question of his health.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_069.wav|46|He already had had complaints.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_300.wav|82|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_154.wav|41|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_211.wav|22|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_077.wav|42|Raised the way you want it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_108.wav|42|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_372.wav|107|This, too, could prove a risky business.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_100.wav|75|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_031.wav|68|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_135.wav|63|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_092.wav|106|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_266.wav|80|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_285.wav|75|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_372.wav|100|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_019.wav|38|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_036.wav|35|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_254.wav|82|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_148.wav|7|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_378.wav|50|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_218.wav|88|I had a son.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_331.wav|3|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_320.wav|63|He has taken the title for the last two years.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_269.wav|98|I've got three other ideas for the day.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_406.wav|76|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_305.wav|46|The chief constable is right.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_386.wav|52|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_339.wav|25|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_227.wav|1|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_193.wav|2|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_149.wav|55|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_206.wav|29|My heart is with the artist.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_065.wav|76|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_234.wav|79|He knew they were there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_196.wav|47|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_027.wav|94|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_019.wav|89|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_012.wav|82|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_436.wav|100|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_390.wav|89|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_007.wav|51|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_214.wav|92|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_246.wav|23|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_222.wav|63|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_130.wav|64|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_128.wav|71|"It's the big omission."
DUMMY2/p301/p301_329.wav|91|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_061.wav|18|A government is a government is a government.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_403.wav|18|She was so supportive.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_263.wav|93|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_309.wav|61|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_264.wav|7|Does that put pressure on us ?)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_210.wav|61|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_051.wav|2|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_261.wav|106|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_068.wav|104|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_185.wav|59|He's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_317.wav|95|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_152.wav|103|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_265.wav|26|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_122.wav|83|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_142.wav|80|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_290.wav|34|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_042.wav|84|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_031.wav|12|I don't believe you own anything.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_016.wav|80|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_158.wav|55|He nearly killed my son.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_111.wav|73|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_253.wav|49|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_232.wav|68|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_306.wav|23|Again the verdict was not proven.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_263.wav|69|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_116.wav|35|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_346.wav|47|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_204.wav|90|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_059.wav|75|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_250.wav|103|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_267.wav|34|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_104.wav|81|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_006.wav|16|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_146.wav|87|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_068.wav|50|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_215.wav|82|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_143.wav|34|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_316.wav|89|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_157.wav|83|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_411.wav|78|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_090.wav|9|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_072.wav|17|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_305.wav|30|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_372.wav|82|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_032.wav|10|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_246.wav|97|We need to tighten up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_393.wav|42|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_312.wav|102|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_134.wav|59|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_215.wav|25|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_179.wav|34|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_337.wav|69|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_348.wav|63|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_387.wav|100|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_217.wav|71|"Clearly, the stakes are high."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_209.wav|65|The labour side has developed in the North area.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_092.wav|96|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_140.wav|93|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_139.wav|80|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_304.wav|83|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_099.wav|89|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_010.wav|91|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_463.wav|50|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_135.wav|24|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_043.wav|98|Yet therein is the problem.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_031.wav|10|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_015.wav|32|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p288/p288_323.wav|47|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_348.wav|77|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_224.wav|21|She is currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_350.wav|46|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_038.wav|54|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_243.wav|12|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_070.wav|46|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_142.wav|62|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_219.wav|60|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_326.wav|27|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_228.wav|27|I will win.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_138.wav|25|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_171.wav|60|And the results were impressive.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_291.wav|61|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_416.wav|1|You have to work with what you've got.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_275.wav|60|It disappeared into the cup.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_074.wav|3|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_275.wav|98|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_082.wav|54|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_346.wav|83|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_270.wav|98|Some injustice was committed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_485.wav|65|I believe in theatre.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_012.wav|50|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_358.wav|70|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_434.wav|105|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_312.wav|55|He had served his time.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_337.wav|64|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_354.wav|58|Do you mean today?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_021.wav|106|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_037.wav|90|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_114.wav|52|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_014.wav|9|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_162.wav|98|I hope he gets it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_097.wav|12|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_385.wav|36|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_228.wav|43|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_138.wav|19|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_284.wav|58|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_350.wav|80|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_089.wav|55|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_244.wav|42|We just wish they had done so before.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_371.wav|18|I thought it was a great game.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_265.wav|34|It's a very high number.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_061.wav|68|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_217.wav|2|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_323.wav|2|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_409.wav|60|What's the problem with change?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_143.wav|41|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_280.wav|52|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_301.wav|72|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_384.wav|46|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_316.wav|94|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_284.wav|88|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_056.wav|42|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_059.wav|95|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_153.wav|53|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_129.wav|92|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_144.wav|24|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_319.wav|52|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_227.wav|75|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_058.wav|80|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_113.wav|82|I have been thinking about that this week.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_334.wav|28|The mood was defiant.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_435.wav|14|It's going to be epic.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_343.wav|29|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_047.wav|9|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_195.wav|11|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_155.wav|87|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_337.wav|55|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_403.wav|85|In my experience, he does not do that.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_196.wav|73|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_059.wav|12|He was taken ill in December last year.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_207.wav|12|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_329.wav|17|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_356.wav|34|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_332.wav|61|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_061.wav|74|He was right of course.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_385.wav|91|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_287.wav|54|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_376.wav|38|I'm delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_384.wav|47|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_263.wav|65|The proposal was rejected.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_100.wav|0|They will notice a difference.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_206.wav|77|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_078.wav|11|This is a great day.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_419.wav|7|I had a fortunate war.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_273.wav|97|We are committed to urgent action.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_007.wav|43|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_127.wav|99|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_365.wav|72|There was no disruption to services.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_239.wav|17|It's a difficult job.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_226.wav|66|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_256.wav|58|We don't have the credible evidence.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_268.wav|40|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_301.wav|36|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_098.wav|93|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_057.wav|10|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_064.wav|90|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_220.wav|17|We will not break even.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_047.wav|60|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_297.wav|43|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_190.wav|43|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_276.wav|56|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_005.wav|21|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_285.wav|54|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_453.wav|50|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_281.wav|35|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_159.wav|61|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_384.wav|74|We have a plan in place.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_031.wav|6|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_386.wav|25|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_388.wav|85|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_349.wav|32|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_122.wav|85|That would depend on the parole board.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_329.wav|23|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_041.wav|104|I've been dying for an hour.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_059.wav|16|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_201.wav|35|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_143.wav|7|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_035.wav|65|This remains the case.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_090.wav|50|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_040.wav|72|He is dying from cancer.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_251.wav|43|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_215.wav|51|We have an attorney on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_414.wav|17|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_098.wav|15|I thought he was my friend.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_157.wav|55|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_132.wav|107|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_223.wav|2|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_234.wav|31|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_241.wav|106|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_088.wav|56|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_197.wav|23|I'm a bit annoyed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_099.wav|40|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_170.wav|104|We have managed to get it under control.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_183.wav|3|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_194.wav|46|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_279.wav|21|We are talking about one family.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_125.wav|56|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_132.wav|46|All the people thought that we would die.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_279.wav|90|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_236.wav|69|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_102.wav|67|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_383.wav|62|They have been for some time now.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_117.wav|103|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_097.wav|52|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_187.wav|37|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_415.wav|8|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_180.wav|33|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_093.wav|55|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_059.wav|97|I've had to take time off work today.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_366.wav|50|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_057.wav|63|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_300.wav|73|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_189.wav|96|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_037.wav|16|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_081.wav|59|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_313.wav|29|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_115.wav|6|We have learned a tremendous amount.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_463.wav|39|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_315.wav|65|Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_041.wav|58|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_261.wav|86|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_340.wav|61|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_050.wav|49|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_265.wav|76|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_024.wav|64|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_276.wav|11|It is our other home.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_116.wav|8|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_114.wav|31|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_106.wav|13|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_136.wav|65|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_126.wav|51|But then he changed his mind.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_312.wav|39|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_207.wav|43|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_210.wav|82|But it is looking very positive.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_251.wav|95|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_199.wav|0|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_013.wav|101|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_345.wav|23|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_119.wav|92|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_063.wav|104|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_313.wav|68|Rapid revision was required.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_095.wav|80|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_185.wav|42|There is no guarantee.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_232.wav|78|Other villages were completely deserted.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_106.wav|48|He will be kept informed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_083.wav|75|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_017.wav|104|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_060.wav|29|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_300.wav|36|He added that the business was in good shape.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_313.wav|86|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_043.wav|15|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_072.wav|41|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_013.wav|55|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_249.wav|69|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_101.wav|88|It is still holding good today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_350.wav|65|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_224.wav|63|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_231.wav|75|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_422.wav|97|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_184.wav|71|"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday."
DUMMY2/p253/p253_080.wav|70|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_403.wav|100|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_181.wav|3|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_167.wav|22|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_110.wav|33|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_189.wav|57|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_278.wav|76|Something was plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_042.wav|59|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_306.wav|15|I don't think that is good enough.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_130.wav|49|This is the high point of my career.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_342.wav|84|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_117.wav|31|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_263.wav|26|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_368.wav|0|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_132.wav|17|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_284.wav|90|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_163.wav|65|There is no doubt there's room for us.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_012.wav|77|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_391.wav|91|I had no qualms about it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_253.wav|70|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_011.wav|60|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_228.wav|46|The damage has been done.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_409.wav|98|I just carry on with my work.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_259.wav|56|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_300.wav|6|How do you feel?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_152.wav|63|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_243.wav|43|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_280.wav|65|Sales will begin by the end of October.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_237.wav|82|Rangers are my life.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_017.wav|17|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_275.wav|103|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_151.wav|48|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_302.wav|13|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_336.wav|26|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_380.wav|91|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_114.wav|2|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_211.wav|3|The trading conditions are not good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_144.wav|11|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_125.wav|48|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_370.wav|26|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_335.wav|95|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_355.wav|68|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_036.wav|22|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_136.wav|101|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_106.wav|7|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_266.wav|6|Two other men have recovered.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_274.wav|90|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_297.wav|1|That was quite an interesting part.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_141.wav|64|The post will run for four years.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_203.wav|60|She would say he was still the best.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_007.wav|80|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_256.wav|47|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_212.wav|62|But my daughter has got nothing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_200.wav|36|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_102.wav|79|I welcome the decision.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_362.wav|100|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_043.wav|38|The offer of help is there for anyone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_433.wav|39|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_408.wav|33|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_295.wav|74|It shows the right amount of progress.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_220.wav|36|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_331.wav|85|But that is not an issue for now.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_101.wav|61|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_170.wav|52|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_243.wav|54|He added, It's not a racial problem.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_071.wav|70|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_380.wav|6|We were very unhappy with the incident.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_340.wav|55|If we get the wrong candidate.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_189.wav|5|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_019.wav|41|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_345.wav|39|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_307.wav|30|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_028.wav|105|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_176.wav|102|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_189.wav|82|We've seen that time and time again.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_390.wav|10|The team hadn't been picked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_089.wav|56|It was a family tragedy.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_147.wav|25|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_175.wav|52|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_156.wav|89|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_069.wav|20|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_180.wav|75|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_397.wav|78|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_422.wav|89|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_057.wav|43|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_188.wav|29|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_247.wav|51|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_317.wav|74|They want that school.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_286.wav|74|I have spoken to my brother.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_243.wav|39|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_113.wav|102|Look at them after three days of rain.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_194.wav|90|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_371.wav|39|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_063.wav|69|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_085.wav|13|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_099.wav|4|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_454.wav|7|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_157.wav|24|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_250.wav|75|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_463.wav|14|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_157.wav|77|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_223.wav|67|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_213.wav|88|I am happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_123.wav|67|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_343.wav|37|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_026.wav|21|I'll go to the races.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_181.wav|94|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_104.wav|7|They will remember this victory for a while.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_369.wav|11|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_068.wav|81|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_440.wav|36|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_299.wav|29|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_304.wav|75|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_111.wav|83|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_013.wav|67|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_322.wav|36|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_314.wav|102|It is just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_112.wav|81|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_409.wav|38|The Master was by then just too old.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_333.wav|0|It makes a compelling display.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_329.wav|52|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_345.wav|95|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_364.wav|56|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_273.wav|89|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_182.wav|97|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_149.wav|4|It's been such a waste of money.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_198.wav|80|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_219.wav|94|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_342.wav|22|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_323.wav|78|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_236.wav|70|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_357.wav|10|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_305.wav|85|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_203.wav|92|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_154.wav|18|The hearing is expected to continue today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_055.wav|24|The teacher would have approved.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_102.wav|87|You should try to have a laugh.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_431.wav|75|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_266.wav|13|Have we not been here before?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_165.wav|3|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_233.wav|2|Wealth is relative.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_499.wav|75|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_125.wav|69|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_153.wav|61|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_079.wav|69|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_182.wav|71|"Miller was every bit as happy."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_237.wav|35|Must have been at the bar.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_370.wav|60|The package is a changing one.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_363.wav|92|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_151.wav|42|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_185.wav|10|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_222.wav|64|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_016.wav|55|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_103.wav|39|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_273.wav|10|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_270.wav|43|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_329.wav|12|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_116.wav|62|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_090.wav|7|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_201.wav|26|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_355.wav|28|He's on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_013.wav|18|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_099.wav|58|It was a bit of a struggle today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_451.wav|65|These days are past.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_292.wav|54|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_232.wav|49|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_081.wav|31|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_051.wav|20|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_040.wav|5|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_180.wav|86|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_116.wav|64|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_025.wav|58|I just went for it over the weekend.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_368.wav|65|We've had some pretty bad times.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_165.wav|59|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_215.wav|11|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_081.wav|12|His options are severely limited.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_290.wav|64|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_138.wav|9|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_175.wav|104|Family members are at her bedside.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_284.wav|47|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_425.wav|24|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_339.wav|99|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_260.wav|31|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_232.wav|42|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_386.wav|18|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_391.wav|98|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_173.wav|87|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_282.wav|106|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_263.wav|62|His arrival could be the making of them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_247.wav|68|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_263.wav|13|They loved it and it showed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_272.wav|95|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_013.wav|74|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_297.wav|78|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_395.wav|98|He is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_304.wav|85|I didn't feel good.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_159.wav|57|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_216.wav|34|Lack of pace is his big problem.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_074.wav|26|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_305.wav|88|I chose the former.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_284.wav|17|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_270.wav|92|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_242.wav|74|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_113.wav|70|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_111.wav|75|The result is a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_254.wav|10|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_127.wav|83|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_059.wav|82|They were willing us to get a second.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_073.wav|91|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_187.wav|81|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_252.wav|76|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_260.wav|85|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_346.wav|16|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_339.wav|16|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_097.wav|45|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_026.wav|27|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_394.wav|33|I am so, so, so lucky.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_139.wav|38|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_058.wav|74|Why does it work?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_024.wav|26|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_463.wav|75|Not if you know the person.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_056.wav|40|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_313.wav|50|I thought he did very well.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_201.wav|30|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_369.wav|55|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_190.wav|15|We will win this tie.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_253.wav|68|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_086.wav|36|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_083.wav|8|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_057.wav|47|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_193.wav|54|He needed seven hours of surgery.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_060.wav|7|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_038.wav|0|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_158.wav|67|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_078.wav|10|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_205.wav|73|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_178.wav|47|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_245.wav|73|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_027.wav|67|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_024.wav|8|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_275.wav|27|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_115.wav|7|New Year will be very busy.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_168.wav|62|What's it for, after all?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_058.wav|95|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_245.wav|46|Do not go into government buildings.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_017.wav|87|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_061.wav|23|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_011.wav|12|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_171.wav|88|You will never replace the child.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_248.wav|96|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_034.wav|65|We are opening an inquiry.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_364.wav|27|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_042.wav|67|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_200.wav|68|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_078.wav|32|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_132.wav|37|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_034.wav|20|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_320.wav|56|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_165.wav|39|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_102.wav|65|I feel confident about the outcome.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_349.wav|44|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_205.wav|105|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_496.wav|75|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_359.wav|64|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_061.wav|80|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_412.wav|6|It was not even this century.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_208.wav|26|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_294.wav|74|We are not collecting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_357.wav|91|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_012.wav|20|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_125.wav|63|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_101.wav|69|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_097.wav|91|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_003.wav|98|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_224.wav|4|But it's just great to have won.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_356.wav|85|It is time for concerted national action.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_155.wav|99|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_031.wav|79|I decided it is going to be William.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_418.wav|37|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_295.wav|84|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_354.wav|92|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_354.wav|31|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_092.wav|75|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_081.wav|50|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_237.wav|84|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_109.wav|20|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_126.wav|89|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_366.wav|2|It seems a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_089.wav|66|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_088.wav|104|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_211.wav|84|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_215.wav|30|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_250.wav|14|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_083.wav|22|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_233.wav|59|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_317.wav|49|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_307.wav|3|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_289.wav|34|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_108.wav|105|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_086.wav|101|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_114.wav|87|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_385.wav|7|I've always been a sensitive.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_011.wav|85|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_110.wav|58|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_208.wav|28|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_295.wav|65|She doesn't know the half of it.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_411.wav|64|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_281.wav|45|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_097.wav|87|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_166.wav|23|It is physical but it is also good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_335.wav|66|He said he needed no more evidence.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_390.wav|0|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_249.wav|96|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_383.wav|35|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_204.wav|30|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_099.wav|33|They were unable to revive him.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_044.wav|4|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_068.wav|79|We are not going to back off.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_277.wav|55|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_294.wav|68|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_297.wav|23|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_139.wav|53|The programme has been made with great care.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_242.wav|52|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_237.wav|104|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_175.wav|107|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_006.wav|43|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_292.wav|106|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_123.wav|36|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_392.wav|85|It will benefit a lot of people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_206.wav|64|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_274.wav|20|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_370.wav|68|Now that was a boxing movie.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_309.wav|21|A compromise is essential.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_270.wav|29|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_063.wav|58|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_135.wav|35|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_324.wav|6|He was in a mood.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_224.wav|43|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_254.wav|13|His game was complete.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_006.wav|89|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_195.wav|40|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_303.wav|32|The partnership was set up during the summer.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_107.wav|65|I was born for this moment.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_157.wav|30|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_059.wav|70|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_473.wav|100|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_046.wav|36|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_213.wav|81|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_119.wav|88|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_286.wav|2|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_212.wav|72|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_004.wav|91|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_139.wav|13|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_327.wav|61|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_325.wav|73|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_144.wav|42|It's my nature.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_016.wav|43|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_336.wav|20|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_136.wav|37|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_020.wav|79|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_365.wav|106|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_096.wav|43|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_138.wav|40|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_372.wav|11|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_433.wav|36|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_334.wav|44|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_301.wav|65|The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_361.wav|9|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_238.wav|87|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_170.wav|57|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_075.wav|74|Would she remember the music?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_281.wav|89|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_165.wav|16|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_154.wav|26|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_144.wav|41|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_335.wav|58|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_237.wav|9|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_360.wav|89|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_047.wav|104|This was no accident.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_176.wav|4|those who are preparing to give up.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_409.wav|69|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_113.wav|49|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_283.wav|87|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_010.wav|77|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_162.wav|9|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_217.wav|39|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_030.wav|50|That deal is a joke.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_060.wav|37|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_053.wav|52|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_297.wav|47|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_017.wav|29|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_417.wav|37|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_141.wav|90|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_134.wav|13|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_400.wav|104|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_160.wav|106|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_201.wav|4|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_309.wav|96|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_193.wav|16|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_391.wav|60|Sometimes we find a person.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_089.wav|23|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_258.wav|8|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_235.wav|75|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_022.wav|82|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_159.wav|88|Mr Blair defended his wife.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_175.wav|37|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_413.wav|97|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_220.wav|41|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_042.wav|48|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_162.wav|79|This means a lot of hard decisions.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_427.wav|39|But we are severely limited in funds.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_087.wav|34|Who does he think will win?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_051.wav|11|We have a problem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_417.wav|74|It is a good result.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_251.wav|78|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_086.wav|48|Or so the theory goes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_172.wav|29|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_391.wav|25|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_210.wav|71|"The FBI could become involved."
DUMMY2/p276/p276_355.wav|106|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_414.wav|14|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_124.wav|59|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_137.wav|41|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_166.wav|89|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_152.wav|6|The progress has been steady.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_334.wav|70|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_250.wav|8|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_056.wav|33|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_150.wav|88|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_399.wav|29|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_223.wav|78|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_119.wav|79|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_148.wav|8|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_158.wav|102|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_075.wav|58|It does not stop at the border.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_163.wav|98|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_174.wav|39|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_154.wav|76|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_305.wav|82|I didn't know she could do that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_236.wav|62|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_180.wav|42|We are committed to urgent action.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_438.wav|63|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_056.wav|2|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_383.wav|0|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_246.wav|64|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_312.wav|47|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_298.wav|100|A senior party insider said.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_061.wav|88|No-one knows the numbers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_177.wav|0|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_405.wav|15|I'd never heard anything like it before.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_097.wav|58|He is a man who lives to work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_291.wav|97|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_367.wav|97|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_140.wav|41|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_077.wav|56|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_283.wav|75|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_185.wav|93|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_353.wav|4|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_164.wav|50|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_151.wav|105|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_385.wav|17|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_360.wav|50|I've always been a sensitive.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_222.wav|0|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_041.wav|71|"It is urgent."
DUMMY2/p298/p298_069.wav|68|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_337.wav|47|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_115.wav|69|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_039.wav|97|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_041.wav|28|It would be a miracle.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_321.wav|22|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_057.wav|92|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_233.wav|107|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_125.wav|7|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_357.wav|63|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_336.wav|50|I think it's about time.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_208.wav|41|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_437.wav|14|We've made a couple of albums.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_259.wav|33|It was like being in prison.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_256.wav|82|You've got to fight to stay up.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_153.wav|23|Who would be out there, singing?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_199.wav|84|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_188.wav|49|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_106.wav|55|And so it went on.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_045.wav|49|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_348.wav|75|The confidence isn't there now.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_280.wav|85|So, how did this happen?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_445.wav|95|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_186.wav|60|I certainly do not agree with that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_051.wav|63|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_214.wav|70|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_131.wav|54|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_188.wav|58|It worked, up to a point.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_099.wav|64|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_352.wav|86|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_083.wav|21|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_175.wav|48|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_410.wav|54|He has never even been to Ireland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_399.wav|48|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_083.wav|71|"They lived for their children."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_014.wav|65|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p334/p334_012.wav|38|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_416.wav|97|This was not the show for me.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_229.wav|96|What was the main difference ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_203.wav|80|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_233.wav|1|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_306.wav|90|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_411.wav|11|It's very tragic and traumatic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_232.wav|93|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_164.wav|97|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_022.wav|93|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_067.wav|99|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_402.wav|37|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_080.wav|17|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_360.wav|6|We're going to sleep.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_094.wav|78|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_423.wav|107|In fact, they should have scored three times.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_277.wav|80|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_326.wav|65|The change could come as soon as September.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_260.wav|84|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_251.wav|76|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_346.wav|8|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_181.wav|79|That's not the way to think.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_273.wav|19|There is no more money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_288.wav|25|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_361.wav|33|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_014.wav|91|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_255.wav|48|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_327.wav|92|The decision was left entirely to him.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_368.wav|7|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_238.wav|50|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_240.wav|9|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_419.wav|32|The second goal was superb.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_026.wav|51|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_262.wav|30|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_380.wav|95|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_104.wav|61|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_047.wav|35|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_229.wav|83|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_343.wav|47|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_344.wav|47|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_363.wav|26|That would help.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_050.wav|68|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_293.wav|12|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_011.wav|33|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_215.wav|103|The court has not decided.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_429.wav|56|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_222.wav|69|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_110.wav|87|Instead, another depression came in.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_276.wav|61|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_173.wav|75|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_199.wav|44|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_025.wav|105|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_105.wav|90|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_288.wav|47|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_179.wav|96|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_268.wav|66|We don't have the credible evidence.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_182.wav|33|That's the way things are heading.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_431.wav|63|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_152.wav|97|T, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_241.wav|7|Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_369.wav|63|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_334.wav|34|It was not known to myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_272.wav|89|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_225.wav|58|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_198.wav|12|Both of them have looked good.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_305.wav|93|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_229.wav|52|I want to see as much progress as possible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_138.wav|60|That's the way they are.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_113.wav|78|He is not a dancer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_212.wav|16|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_164.wav|76|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_224.wav|44|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_155.wav|96|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_320.wav|104|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_411.wav|51|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_134.wav|103|Is that too much to ask?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_192.wav|81|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_398.wav|91|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_215.wav|35|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_068.wav|69|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_330.wav|22|It will also take evidence from consumers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_314.wav|50|I'm not making any comment at all.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_337.wav|91|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_311.wav|17|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_192.wav|8|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_317.wav|91|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_184.wav|86|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_380.wav|63|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_268.wav|102|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_225.wav|101|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_101.wav|59|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_407.wav|95|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_110.wav|67|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_093.wav|1|This will be great for the young lads.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_094.wav|50|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_110.wav|24|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_131.wav|26|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_271.wav|81|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_368.wav|58|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_422.wav|46|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_498.wav|75|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_363.wav|10|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_357.wav|43|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_016.wav|91|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_253.wav|5|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_422.wav|27|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_089.wav|86|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_082.wav|88|No-one has spoken to me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_122.wav|81|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_265.wav|28|But there are some problems.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_229.wav|40|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_420.wav|34|The commission is not the only loser.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_142.wav|30|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_139.wav|55|It should have its own network.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_139.wav|100|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_011.wav|53|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_193.wav|41|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_219.wav|91|What are you not good at?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_310.wav|84|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_184.wav|41|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_274.wav|60|Neither had the public.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_328.wav|5|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_303.wav|79|Is it worth it?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_289.wav|42|I couldn't put my finger on it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_095.wav|92|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_117.wav|19|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_057.wav|55|We wish to win, but not at any price.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_155.wav|68|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_053.wav|81|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_355.wav|51|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_060.wav|85|However, our players will fight for that.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_006.wav|107|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_203.wav|72|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_343.wav|73|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_178.wav|93|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_036.wav|13|PR will be just one of them.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_115.wav|83|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_330.wav|14|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_410.wav|96|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_384.wav|40|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_095.wav|89|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_067.wav|38|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_058.wav|22|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_082.wav|13|I was in prison for a year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_154.wav|4|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_348.wav|92|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_288.wav|7|It is probably in the culture.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_114.wav|84|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_453.wav|36|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_283.wav|106|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_217.wav|70|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_307.wav|9|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_351.wav|14|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_026.wav|66|That's interesting to me.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_278.wav|56|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_110.wav|89|You should be.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_383.wav|25|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_283.wav|69|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_301.wav|10|So the Government will be damaged.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_275.wav|33|This is not a message from ministers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_071.wav|37|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_246.wav|81|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_287.wav|87|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_389.wav|42|I hope the voters will respond.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_281.wav|34|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_150.wav|71|"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_048.wav|63|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_117.wav|1|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_115.wav|32|However, the problem is the timing.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_287.wav|100|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_179.wav|77|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_073.wav|8|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_311.wav|70|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_196.wav|48|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_214.wav|57|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_001.wav|6|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_410.wav|87|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_247.wav|26|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_283.wav|96|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_035.wav|6|I think it is wide open.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_388.wav|84|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_413.wav|89|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_321.wav|105|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_015.wav|3|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_352.wav|74|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_151.wav|45|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_380.wav|104|Visitors were also impressed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_174.wav|43|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_069.wav|87|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_223.wav|31|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_132.wav|31|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_171.wav|86|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_316.wav|0|He has left the company.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_104.wav|94|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_251.wav|24|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_384.wav|87|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_333.wav|21|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_050.wav|86|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_024.wav|82|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_213.wav|58|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_045.wav|37|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_341.wav|65|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_221.wav|12|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_340.wav|31|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_286.wav|18|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_316.wav|11|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_134.wav|66|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_068.wav|15|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_417.wav|42|This is his personal life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_374.wav|40|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_357.wav|23|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_092.wav|33|Four had been brought down.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_039.wav|82|A killer is also on the loose.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_176.wav|89|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_056.wav|18|There are two things we have to do.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_356.wav|18|Could it be?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_096.wav|106|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_235.wav|104|We're talking about one or two years.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_241.wav|104|I couldn't have asked for better.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_201.wav|19|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_324.wav|35|We were on our way.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_083.wav|27|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_293.wav|32|And Michael was just great.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_247.wav|57|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_362.wav|85|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_073.wav|2|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_359.wav|1|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_144.wav|16|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_052.wav|32|The latter were not from Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_246.wav|3|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_350.wav|28|I'm really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_223.wav|11|I wonder what they listen to?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_136.wav|38|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_362.wav|69|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_176.wav|9|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_036.wav|56|This will save interest charges.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_382.wav|103|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_237.wav|86|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_149.wav|73|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_408.wav|8|Of course, it is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_091.wav|78|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_157.wav|82|No, you couldn't make it up.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_085.wav|60|He became enchanted with the process.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_342.wav|73|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_215.wav|7|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_247.wav|98|He has to pull back from the brink.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_179.wav|12|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_382.wav|107|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p284/p284_294.wav|16|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_233.wav|8|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_133.wav|91|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_258.wav|65|The group's increasing scale will help.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_190.wav|64|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_238.wav|35|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_226.wav|27|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_016.wav|12|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_158.wav|107|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_375.wav|36|There was a thing in front of the camera.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_326.wav|59|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_363.wav|57|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_354.wav|57|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_130.wav|33|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_200.wav|41|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_257.wav|76|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_313.wav|34|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_045.wav|31|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_367.wav|65|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_274.wav|84|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_294.wav|65|If so, we want to hear from them.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_328.wav|29|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_013.wav|16|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_128.wav|74|There may be some resistance.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_355.wav|50|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_174.wav|73|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_097.wav|6|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_326.wav|13|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_144.wav|91|This was not just incongruous.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_197.wav|53|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_365.wav|27|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_129.wav|11|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_044.wav|75|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_250.wav|78|Sadly, it could not be done.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_236.wav|6|I think it's more important to have fun.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_050.wav|1|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_215.wav|42|This club have been fair to me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_145.wav|42|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_338.wav|57|This is a friendly match ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_155.wav|15|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_210.wav|35|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_097.wav|53|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_269.wav|52|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_137.wav|44|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_314.wav|35|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_154.wav|23|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_030.wav|21|People don't feel safe, including me.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_202.wav|85|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_050.wav|54|But don't expect an easy ride.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_242.wav|53|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_160.wav|72|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_273.wav|99|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_162.wav|32|We came across the first set of bodies.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_264.wav|105|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_201.wav|2|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_211.wav|52|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_378.wav|6|I have no evidence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_117.wav|34|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_065.wav|33|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_194.wav|2|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_010.wav|100|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_061.wav|17|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_187.wav|6|The prime minister will make the decision.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_254.wav|9|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_109.wav|17|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_417.wav|79|We are very, very confident.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_085.wav|88|He dismissed the action.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_358.wav|48|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_041.wav|72|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_405.wav|33|But is he?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_071.wav|80|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_027.wav|93|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_001.wav|74|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_256.wav|100|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_024.wav|45|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_077.wav|22|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_048.wav|21|He is trying really hard.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_174.wav|14|The strong pound also took its toll.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_261.wav|46|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_407.wav|15|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_203.wav|103|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_260.wav|32|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_179.wav|107|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_260.wav|5|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_107.wav|6|I am the head.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_120.wav|5|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_042.wav|54|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_293.wav|31|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_114.wav|15|He had returned to die.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_265.wav|52|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_396.wav|89|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_145.wav|8|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_245.wav|66|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_007.wav|68|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_220.wav|27|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_156.wav|87|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_208.wav|32|Which isn't a bad idea.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_408.wav|56|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_209.wav|85|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_325.wav|21|Our thoughts are with her.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_125.wav|73|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_206.wav|85|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_113.wav|48|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_156.wav|37|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_154.wav|102|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_253.wav|71|"That is highly unfair."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_156.wav|50|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_010.wav|52|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_006.wav|71|"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. "
DUMMY2/p284/p284_016.wav|16|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_183.wav|65|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_298.wav|103|This is not a faceless system.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_054.wav|17|They were not defeated.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_370.wav|35|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_446.wav|100|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_248.wav|41|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_347.wav|12|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_005.wav|68|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_407.wav|106|Its failure is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_143.wav|10|Others are not so sure.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_044.wav|47|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_118.wav|80|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_330.wav|92|That's always the case, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_333.wav|1|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_380.wav|76|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_086.wav|83|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_283.wav|20|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_172.wav|59|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_106.wav|52|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_208.wav|100|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_409.wav|79|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_414.wav|26|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_217.wav|12|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_206.wav|54|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_197.wav|37|His words were not audible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_194.wav|83|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_206.wav|106|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_143.wav|79|They received no money under the merger.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_329.wav|65|We are a husband and wife team.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_350.wav|99|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_322.wav|80|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_106.wav|105|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_091.wav|79|Where are they?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_188.wav|28|I want to be there by right.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_198.wav|14|It caused a lot of upset.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_386.wav|49|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_287.wav|104|This could take a few days.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_133.wav|18|It happened again yesterday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_042.wav|44|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_262.wav|84|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_114.wav|45|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_192.wav|65|Is there a waiting list?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_106.wav|15|So is that it, then?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_041.wav|23|I would just like someone to confess.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_062.wav|68|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_012.wav|36|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_435.wav|50|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_362.wav|56|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_084.wav|92|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_057.wav|87|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_148.wav|15|It was that kind of match.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_358.wav|22|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_265.wav|1|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_311.wav|98|That is when we are really effective.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_246.wav|18|Now, that would impress the kids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_281.wav|36|The demand is created by the supply.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_098.wav|30|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_213.wav|50|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_043.wav|37|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_408.wav|98|As if he would.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_287.wav|0|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_095.wav|10|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_347.wav|66|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_380.wav|24|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_264.wav|29|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_197.wav|6|I wanted to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_413.wav|46|We are going through difficult times.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_244.wav|7|People should make their own decisions.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_257.wav|37|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_080.wav|44|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_213.wav|92|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_377.wav|24|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_250.wav|59|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_002.wav|66|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_349.wav|100|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_170.wav|75|That is not the case.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_136.wav|4|Parole isn't a decision for me.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_224.wav|64|It could not be too high.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_414.wav|27|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_280.wav|92|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_138.wav|97|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_323.wav|80|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_028.wav|32|This is a central issue.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_294.wav|67|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_320.wav|74|The last few weeks have been really bad.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_320.wav|47|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_056.wav|90|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_050.wav|32|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_142.wav|25|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_397.wav|26|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_166.wav|101|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_303.wav|67|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_387.wav|10|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_214.wav|55|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_100.wav|2|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_248.wav|15|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_033.wav|30|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_204.wav|3|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_182.wav|46|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_401.wav|54|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_368.wav|67|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_145.wav|85|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_027.wav|12|This is not an amnesty.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_457.wav|106|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_380.wav|52|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_366.wav|83|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_290.wav|103|We had no part in it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_033.wav|0|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_248.wav|106|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_052.wav|19|What were they?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_225.wav|10|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_073.wav|98|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_143.wav|0|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_065.wav|85|The problem is not confined to the UK.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_112.wav|61|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_053.wav|86|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_368.wav|102|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_224.wav|62|We want to sort it out.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_351.wav|1|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_060.wav|4|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_228.wav|82|But he is not hopeful.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_220.wav|2|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_036.wav|98|I want to make a vigorous defence.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_077.wav|79|I wouldn't give them a grade.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_324.wav|17|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_073.wav|88|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_240.wav|45|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_372.wav|13|The Cup has come home.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_108.wav|43|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_259.wav|45|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_243.wav|63|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_061.wav|13|A killer is also on the loose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_008.wav|99|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_131.wav|94|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_279.wav|77|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_029.wav|80|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_291.wav|56|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_399.wav|11|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_260.wav|35|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_104.wav|32|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_069.wav|30|I hope we can put it behind us.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_074.wav|68|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_111.wav|102|I'm not a diva.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_092.wav|43|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_043.wav|102|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_436.wav|48|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_238.wav|30|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_361.wav|19|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_410.wav|1|What does he want him to look like?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_062.wav|83|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_367.wav|92|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_353.wav|96|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_335.wav|37|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_032.wav|33|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_235.wav|29|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_192.wav|99|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_133.wav|2|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_131.wav|46|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_131.wav|76|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_294.wav|48|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_228.wav|97|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_334.wav|33|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_106.wav|57|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_318.wav|68|We have grown up in Britain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_210.wav|87|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_342.wav|99|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_160.wav|100|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_314.wav|107|Tonight's matches European Championship.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_053.wav|42|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_093.wav|106|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_318.wav|99|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_339.wav|81|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_074.wav|23|We've had our problems at the club.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_155.wav|93|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_214.wav|54|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_039.wav|107|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_297.wav|80|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_037.wav|82|I was completely knackered.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_339.wav|102|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_332.wav|43|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_359.wav|31|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_088.wav|73|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_007.wav|5|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_046.wav|32|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_149.wav|93|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_047.wav|43|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_321.wav|106|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_230.wav|84|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_197.wav|27|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_202.wav|53|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_034.wav|57|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_022.wav|11|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_013.wav|22|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_230.wav|23|We had no idea that this letter existed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_100.wav|85|I kept it very simple.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_075.wav|36|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_274.wav|101|We have not reached the point of no return.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_371.wav|86|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_086.wav|93|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p246/p246_202.wav|5|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_264.wav|8|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_281.wav|92|Surely it can't get any worse.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_230.wav|75|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_158.wav|1|His only reply was a laugh.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_028.wav|18|It's a big mystery.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_366.wav|72|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_072.wav|37|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_238.wav|14|A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_234.wav|16|The whole thing will be great.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_133.wav|55|Eight others have followed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_300.wav|88|I really want to win in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_387.wav|106|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_388.wav|67|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_271.wav|56|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_100.wav|61|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_281.wav|85|It's all a part of letting it go.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_363.wav|20|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_306.wav|52|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_110.wav|40|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_410.wav|42|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_368.wav|66|I don't have a new house.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_115.wav|77|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_162.wav|46|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_116.wav|86|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_102.wav|66|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_074.wav|45|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_383.wav|102|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_168.wav|94|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_133.wav|93|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_201.wav|72|The same goes for McKenna.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_170.wav|81|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_199.wav|28|Everyone knew where they were.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_094.wav|54|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_245.wav|104|Some days are different from others.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_154.wav|104|Therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_298.wav|5|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_224.wav|92|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_331.wav|94|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_054.wav|58|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_053.wav|48|I remember that day well.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_376.wav|21|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_333.wav|55|But it won't help British farmers.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_066.wav|73|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_159.wav|56|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_265.wav|19|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_047.wav|82|His record with England was not good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_334.wav|62|However, she is female, and so.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_358.wav|23|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_147.wav|42|We had a really good experience with David.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_166.wav|25|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_337.wav|48|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_180.wav|11|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_341.wav|9|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_486.wav|24|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_170.wav|15|We've got to get back to normal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_033.wav|15|The British government said she was coming home.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_422.wav|103|The country is in a state of chaos.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_047.wav|49|That, though, is the measure of the man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_068.wav|68|Some people still think she should be English.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_176.wav|65|No-one wants to talk about death.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_328.wav|34|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_236.wav|46|It is a cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_218.wav|49|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_021.wav|82|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_303.wav|9|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_126.wav|34|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_160.wav|107|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_169.wav|57|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_238.wav|36|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_396.wav|36|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_252.wav|73|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_431.wav|7|It is not over by any means.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_094.wav|66|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_436.wav|37|The only problem was, they were on himself.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_422.wav|38|It's not realistic because it's early days.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_234.wav|35|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_343.wav|67|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_316.wav|10|You have asked for action.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_416.wav|50|There is some light in the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_052.wav|58|That was the problem.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_136.wav|88|But he's a very quiet man.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_298.wav|30|It all seemed so easy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_013.wav|39|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_154.wav|5|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_158.wav|18|The day may come, but not for a while.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_465.wav|24|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_460.wav|48|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_313.wav|55|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_033.wav|42|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_255.wav|34|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_007.wav|20|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_107.wav|63|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_049.wav|54|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_128.wav|70|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_394.wav|20|They are good.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_382.wav|58|We believe the squad will stay together.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_141.wav|106|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_149.wav|53|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_206.wav|92|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_138.wav|68|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_277.wav|42|It does not move, which is amazing.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_241.wav|67|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_373.wav|14|Neither woman has been named.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_063.wav|60|But it would say that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_053.wav|94|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_220.wav|29|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_164.wav|8|The woman was his wife.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_051.wav|13|Five officers were injured.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_126.wav|27|The people will come.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_218.wav|67|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_263.wav|60|It can take a long time.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_311.wav|91|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_328.wav|14|We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_105.wav|41|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_078.wav|51|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_294.wav|40|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_375.wav|40|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_389.wav|102|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_296.wav|50|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_155.wav|97|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_055.wav|60|But here it is also very bad.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_206.wav|26|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_135.wav|36|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_301.wav|56|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_205.wav|104|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_382.wav|96|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_237.wav|5|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_414.wav|72|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_234.wav|32|It depends on Labour, not on us.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_260.wav|45|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_260.wav|87|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_210.wav|10|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_328.wav|39|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_355.wav|97|What's a boy to do?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_174.wav|52|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_369.wav|70|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_272.wav|84|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_251.wav|47|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_120.wav|102|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_096.wav|46|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_100.wav|39|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_344.wav|106|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_404.wav|26|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_217.wav|11|I had nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_019.wav|54|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_176.wav|20|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_107.wav|91|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_230.wav|98|I wish him well for the future.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_180.wav|20|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_376.wav|19|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_365.wav|107|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_196.wav|80|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_264.wav|81|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_167.wav|50|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_171.wav|7|It's never great to finish second.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_034.wav|27|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_069.wav|71|"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_309.wav|33|Then you see it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_005.wav|76|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_328.wav|7|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_205.wav|12|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_194.wav|34|You could see he was thinking about it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_080.wav|94|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_065.wav|82|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_235.wav|92|It's about attitudes to change.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_111.wav|103|They agree to meet.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_436.wav|50|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_424.wav|48|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_066.wav|97|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_309.wav|9|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_123.wav|41|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_397.wav|82|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_400.wav|103|We have high hopes that this will work.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_228.wav|78|We want this place to work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_208.wav|31|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_378.wav|67|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_291.wav|96|They were also beside themselves.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_175.wav|39|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_194.wav|19|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_099.wav|98|That statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_214.wav|76|We are a party for people, not against people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_339.wav|77|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_203.wav|45|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_284.wav|40|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_329.wav|49|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_251.wav|86|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_104.wav|33|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_176.wav|103|The show is small but perfectly formed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_404.wav|91|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_174.wav|90|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_322.wav|52|We will not simply hit these people.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_108.wav|104|That's not part of the deal.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_348.wav|105|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_206.wav|34|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_107.wav|0|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_142.wav|102|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_312.wav|9|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_194.wav|57|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_065.wav|79|I thought it was quite a positive result.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_062.wav|81|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_155.wav|34|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_245.wav|7|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_216.wav|94|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_308.wav|51|A counter reaction was.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_082.wav|4|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_060.wav|103|In short, the club was broke.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_212.wav|97|It's a production company.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_058.wav|91|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_077.wav|72|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_162.wav|26|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_291.wav|41|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_389.wav|105|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_185.wav|8|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_022.wav|101|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_310.wav|97|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_208.wav|50|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_383.wav|23|The penalty was the turning point.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_245.wav|30|Mr Miller is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_333.wav|72|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_396.wav|18|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_359.wav|40|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_212.wav|95|We are not making any comment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_126.wav|90|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_025.wav|79|Something has to be done.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_054.wav|102|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_197.wav|92|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_019.wav|96|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_045.wav|61|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_118.wav|16|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_340.wav|70|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_051.wav|85|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_144.wav|44|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_090.wav|105|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_115.wav|13|I'm just going to do my best.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_458.wav|14|It might be useful to have something in black and white.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_146.wav|49|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_309.wav|86|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_172.wav|16|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_161.wav|46|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_053.wav|36|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_072.wav|100|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_227.wav|68|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_003.wav|25|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_422.wav|32|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_079.wav|30|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_192.wav|5|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_145.wav|72|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_262.wav|53|There would be a north and south division.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_178.wav|68|You let a lot of people down.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_392.wav|95|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_318.wav|5|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_256.wav|79|They seem to be, anyway.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_167.wav|31|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_033.wav|88|We're not either of those things.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_065.wav|105|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_108.wav|40|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_205.wav|67|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_047.wav|80|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_349.wav|36|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_422.wav|39|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_104.wav|35|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_129.wav|9|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_172.wav|90|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_164.wav|70|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_063.wav|50|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_416.wav|75|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_159.wav|31|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_112.wav|41|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_175.wav|20|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_300.wav|46|This has a number of benefits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_343.wav|105|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_218.wav|36|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_139.wav|52|The programme has been made with great care.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_088.wav|32|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_347.wav|13|The girls are ready to compete.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_144.wav|4|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_276.wav|19|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_261.wav|68|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_245.wav|69|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_304.wav|66|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_411.wav|46|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_001.wav|96|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_160.wav|70|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_249.wav|24|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_275.wav|71|"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_401.wav|46|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_314.wav|61|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_331.wav|49|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_032.wav|7|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_243.wav|21|Where are you taking her?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_152.wav|18|It was an amazing time.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_036.wav|2|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_192.wav|52|I am fighting the force of nature.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_168.wav|93|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_305.wav|32|Her body was found on Monday morning.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_316.wav|1|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_217.wav|4|This was a lot of numbers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_229.wav|69|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_091.wav|96|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_354.wav|49|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_327.wav|79|Every case is completely different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_242.wav|47|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_251.wav|15|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_207.wav|14|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_255.wav|4|The film has also been superbly designed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_206.wav|104|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_322.wav|44|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_358.wav|53|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_248.wav|38|I'll always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_347.wav|46|It has made a difference.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_122.wav|98|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_337.wav|101|But they have the sound.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_359.wav|7|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_057.wav|9|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_010.wav|71|"People look, but no one ever finds it. "
DUMMY2/p281/p281_384.wav|36|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_262.wav|95|They have not been in touch with the club.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_116.wav|18|I feel strongly about it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_249.wav|14|Others agreed with this view.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_337.wav|73|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_088.wav|31|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_277.wav|76|It's an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_130.wav|0|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_140.wav|34|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_167.wav|107|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_062.wav|38|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_320.wav|64|We will just get on with it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_336.wav|100|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_132.wav|97|I think it is wide open.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_229.wav|75|Death is outside the language.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_164.wav|57|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_159.wav|48|It was the climax of the thing.

DUMMY2/p253/p253_268.wav|70|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_255.wav|69|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_262.wav|71|"Frankly, we should all have such problems."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_245.wav|59|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_055.wav|50|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_308.wav|49|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_366.wav|64|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_235.wav|74|It's hard to say.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_127.wav|91|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_284.wav|80|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_251.wav|2|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_090.wav|39|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_411.wav|4|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_242.wav|45|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_346.wav|11|That was about it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_248.wav|64|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_057.wav|102|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_389.wav|66|Is this new report the answer?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_103.wav|3|Police said the family was helping with the search.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_219.wav|86|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_394.wav|55|He could still be President.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_139.wav|81|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_234.wav|100|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_182.wav|87|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_269.wav|4|The kids are paying the price.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_095.wav|34|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_282.wav|38|Military chiefs were playing it straight.

DUMMY2/p225/p225_197.wav|101|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_013.wav|75|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_249.wav|20|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_041.wav|77|This will get their attention.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_259.wav|7|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_340.wav|23|I have great sympathy with these people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_017.wav|102|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_221.wav|18|You cannot do that in a lobby.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_308.wav|55|We have achieved that.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_156.wav|23|It's something he has worked very hard on.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_273.wav|12|The board has rejected her proposals.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_336.wav|81|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_080.wav|103|We will see how he is after treatment.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_260.wav|91|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_062.wav|1|Many, many people don't know who he is.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_001.wav|38|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_328.wav|43|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_113.wav|105|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_405.wav|27|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_207.wav|53|I want an answer from the British Government.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_238.wav|62|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_243.wav|57|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_267.wav|8|It is probably in the culture.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_004.wav|99|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_233.wav|75|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_025.wav|35|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_300.wav|19|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_283.wav|6|And the other winners are.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_219.wav|13|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_223.wav|33|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_313.wav|57|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_230.wav|20|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_184.wav|24|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_242.wav|11|It could now be up to the courts.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_284.wav|68|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_422.wav|65|We have some options there.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_069.wav|97|How do you resurrect a dying town?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_017.wav|79|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_239.wav|87|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_119.wav|80|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_120.wav|38|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_061.wav|107|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_415.wav|15|It raises the edge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_183.wav|74|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_337.wav|66|It is the logical extension of audio description.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_160.wav|92|We're in England for the time being.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_187.wav|85|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_432.wav|27|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_249.wav|56|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_323.wav|103|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_268.wav|107|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_091.wav|49|The proposal was rejected.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_142.wav|96|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_151.wav|9|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_074.wav|104|This is the real thing now.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_408.wav|63|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_439.wav|75|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_391.wav|39|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_210.wav|43|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_082.wav|23|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_028.wav|4|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_225.wav|20|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_361.wav|83|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_007.wav|56|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_258.wav|25|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_057.wav|76|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_429.wav|105|It's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_139.wav|91|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_102.wav|12|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_133.wav|80|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_042.wav|6|There is a new confidence about the club.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_050.wav|26|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_260.wav|56|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_441.wav|106|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_032.wav|8|We have to find a way to put that right.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_259.wav|79|Or is he?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_273.wav|106|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_062.wav|54|That tells you something about them.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_331.wav|50|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_203.wav|86|He's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_416.wav|22|So now this series has had its day.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_081.wav|6|There is room for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_389.wav|107|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_129.wav|69|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_378.wav|23|It is three years at present.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_238.wav|40|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_099.wav|85|It's a sensible management decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_020.wav|58|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_089.wav|8|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_185.wav|97|The group would never be the same again.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_326.wav|52|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_153.wav|51|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_249.wav|81|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_177.wav|73|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_374.wav|25|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_354.wav|79|It must not happen.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_179.wav|14|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_080.wav|15|I found the course inspiring.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_213.wav|33|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_335.wav|24|It was nice to finish in style.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_503.wav|48|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_153.wav|70|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_120.wav|70|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_275.wav|42|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_201.wav|8|In France, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_366.wav|27|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_301.wav|77|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_413.wav|95|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_166.wav|13|We want to replicate that success.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_233.wav|15|However, our players will fight for that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_288.wav|88|It will not be today, though.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_421.wav|40|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_212.wav|102|He was too good for me - too consistent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_372.wav|94|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_183.wav|46|This area is perfect for children.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_217.wav|83|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_340.wav|34|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_211.wav|82|Drugs are getting through.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_120.wav|54|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_263.wav|5|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_384.wav|32|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_302.wav|62|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_083.wav|16|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_090.wav|36|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_301.wav|106|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_364.wav|13|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_306.wav|35|Rugby is now just like football.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_233.wav|70|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_360.wav|96|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_366.wav|40|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_099.wav|28|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_056.wav|52|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_367.wav|68|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_425.wav|14|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_115.wav|57|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_349.wav|74|The improvement today was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_247.wav|34|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_092.wav|18|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_196.wav|91|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_212.wav|23|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_127.wav|67|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_232.wav|59|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_127.wav|68|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_127.wav|74|This is not the case.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_319.wav|80|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_081.wav|9|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_203.wav|96|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_349.wav|82|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_176.wav|83|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_221.wav|56|That was a problem for me.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_097.wav|31|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_066.wav|34|The six others were injured.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_292.wav|56|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_280.wav|75|It has all been done in secret.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_284.wav|69|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p244/p244_110.wav|78|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_382.wav|52|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_233.wav|42|We need a visionary producer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_278.wav|75|We have the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_122.wav|6|Sadly, it is not to be.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_019.wav|19|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_082.wav|84|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_198.wav|63|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_343.wav|46|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_144.wav|5|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_284.wav|96|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_021.wav|4|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_054.wav|5|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_199.wav|34|It was an accounting error.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_161.wav|32|He was in great spirits.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_043.wav|60|That has now gone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_135.wav|101|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_273.wav|14|Is our children learning ?)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_277.wav|51|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_163.wav|26|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_277.wav|38|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_296.wav|73|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_020.wav|53|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_086.wav|71|"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit."
DUMMY2/p335/p335_290.wav|49|He did not oppose the divorce.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_107.wav|45|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_176.wav|46|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_337.wav|4|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_019.wav|34|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_248.wav|87|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_105.wav|19|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_361.wav|79|I am very sorry to be here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_289.wav|3|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_265.wav|46|Well, when did he ever refuse?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_464.wav|63|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_165.wav|48|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_310.wav|3|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_313.wav|33|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_086.wav|85|Can you imagine a world without design?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_032.wav|23|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_206.wav|105|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_396.wav|47|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_142.wav|57|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_143.wav|35|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_221.wav|79|It is a performance.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_071.wav|99|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_132.wav|0|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_399.wav|32|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_201.wav|106|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_378.wav|56|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_052.wav|54|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_338.wav|18|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_403.wav|8|There's still no-one like him.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_022.wav|3|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_061.wav|62|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_204.wav|94|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_342.wav|43|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_262.wav|104|I thought he was terrific.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_077.wav|58|How can they say that?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_090.wav|80|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_195.wav|59|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_359.wav|107|The discussions will surely not last too long.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_212.wav|79|I am a socialist.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_021.wav|39|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_021.wav|12|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_103.wav|17|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_027.wav|27|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_321.wav|34|My mother was getting on at me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_278.wav|58|It was a long process, but we got there.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_033.wav|25|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_339.wav|91|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_365.wav|93|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_190.wav|26|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_310.wav|13|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_032.wav|18|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_192.wav|43|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_114.wav|16|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_224.wav|25|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_079.wav|56|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_098.wav|64|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_197.wav|34|It was a good atmosphere.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_003.wav|9|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_049.wav|93|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_322.wav|93|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_262.wav|61|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_085.wav|58|Israel has done very little until now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_140.wav|52|There was only one living room, you see.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_325.wav|43|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_085.wav|15|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_412.wav|26|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_146.wav|12|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_261.wav|12|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_215.wav|73|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_022.wav|17|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_197.wav|25|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_207.wav|80|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_124.wav|105|That's all right then.

DUMMY2/p341/p341_017.wav|66|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_077.wav|98|We couldn't afford it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_139.wav|83|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_328.wav|61|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_053.wav|28|Labour was too busy to respond.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_305.wav|22|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_251.wav|31|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_222.wav|53|We are still seeking that complete performance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_136.wav|41|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.

DUMMY2/p252/p252_090.wav|55|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_175.wav|86|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p243/p243_179.wav|53|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_252.wav|89|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_156.wav|39|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_159.wav|96|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_306.wav|4|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_145.wav|11|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_181.wav|46|In fact, they should have scored three times.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_154.wav|75|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_183.wav|41|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_062.wav|5|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_124.wav|57|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_121.wav|6|That takes a lot of courage.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_016.wav|28|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.

DUMMY2/p266/p266_232.wav|20|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_282.wav|8|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_294.wav|30|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_309.wav|93|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_371.wav|38|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_157.wav|69|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_309.wav|70|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_090.wav|8|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_101.wav|40|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_115.wav|92|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_267.wav|105|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_338.wav|52|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_005.wav|16|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_413.wav|6|That was really tough.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_074.wav|90|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_025.wav|3|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_343.wav|76|It's no less intriguing, however.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_036.wav|61|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_071.wav|54|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_293.wav|36|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_368.wav|54|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_201.wav|95|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_235.wav|53|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_148.wav|62|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_385.wav|47|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_270.wav|76|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_056.wav|55|He was failed by his health authority.

DUMMY2/p303/p303_176.wav|44|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_280.wav|17|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_026.wav|100|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_319.wav|14|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_141.wav|53|I am not under any new pressure.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_388.wav|10|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_332.wav|33|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_432.wav|39|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_195.wav|103|It is a scandal.

DUMMY2/p281/p281_142.wav|36|It opens the door to the Champions League.

DUMMY2/p279/p279_073.wav|25|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_274.wav|38|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_161.wav|90|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_083.wav|85|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_366.wav|46|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_085.wav|82|I would have been shot dead in bed.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_297.wav|100|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_109.wav|7|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_328.wav|45|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_335.wav|55|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_394.wav|63|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_349.wav|1|We are very very proud of Alain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_261.wav|100|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_001.wav|44|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_121.wav|19|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_322.wav|96|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_084.wav|38|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_246.wav|28|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_283.wav|16|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_223.wav|102|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_366.wav|20|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_180.wav|92|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_099.wav|32|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_234.wav|73|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_038.wav|55|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_322.wav|21|It is now being examined.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_133.wav|32|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_076.wav|81|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_387.wav|45|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_212.wav|80|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_021.wav|19|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_308.wav|32|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_279.wav|69|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_229.wav|42|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_414.wav|89|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_358.wav|85|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_018.wav|94|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_261.wav|16|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_181.wav|19|I hope we do.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_117.wav|15|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_038.wav|2|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_068.wav|49|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_144.wav|63|The first half was depressing.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_209.wav|46|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_040.wav|88|I thought it was the only way out.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_216.wav|65|Henry should go now.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_348.wav|15|They are a very good team.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_194.wav|77|They might be surprised by the response.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_088.wav|70|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_360.wav|34|This is a critical time for football.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_017.wav|95|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_001.wav|21|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_132.wav|2|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_308.wav|36|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_293.wav|49|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_160.wav|79|That is the sensible outcome.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_047.wav|14|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_313.wav|48|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_219.wav|19|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_178.wav|79|I was just aghast.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_310.wav|41|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_268.wav|67|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_472.wav|7|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_082.wav|77|He added that he felt undermined.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_363.wav|2|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_336.wav|5|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_190.wav|54|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_202.wav|48|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_049.wav|89|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_026.wav|77|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_015.wav|6|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_351.wav|77|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_193.wav|82|This is a very high price.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_089.wav|52|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_163.wav|32|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_290.wav|18|And yet, there has been no great impact.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_071.wav|30|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_186.wav|3|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_352.wav|68|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_220.wav|104|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_060.wav|30|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_311.wav|26|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_078.wav|74|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_096.wav|65|What do we want to do that for?)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_257.wav|89|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_142.wav|17|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_103.wav|12|Housing is in very short supply.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_366.wav|66|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_057.wav|64|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_311.wav|9|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_344.wav|69|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_343.wav|59|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_095.wav|17|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_003.wav|4|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_287.wav|96|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_298.wav|43|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_356.wav|89|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_140.wav|7|I'm so grateful for that.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_032.wav|53|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_310.wav|24|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_032.wav|80|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_055.wav|58|Everything else is second.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_238.wav|71|"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_343.wav|10|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_332.wav|73|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_095.wav|44|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_291.wav|75|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_377.wav|29|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_031.wav|19|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_328.wav|10|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_412.wav|39|It looked like a river.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_269.wav|8|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_116.wav|27|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_021.wav|14|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p287/p287_117.wav|77|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_157.wav|40|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_136.wav|66|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_054.wav|97|I am going home to see my children.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_342.wav|15|They are in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_024.wav|30|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_141.wav|40|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_067.wav|90|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_332.wav|93|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_082.wav|14|It happens on an annual basis.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_171.wav|92|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_151.wav|103|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_216.wav|77|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_148.wav|1|There was nothing else to match it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_199.wav|65|How do you take them away?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_188.wav|64|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_111.wav|34|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_165.wav|49|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_017.wav|46|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_084.wav|0|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_050.wav|23|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_247.wav|20|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_215.wav|79|You can blame the defence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_144.wav|89|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_218.wav|95|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_182.wav|96|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_109.wav|61|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_109.wav|51|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_097.wav|50|We should recognise others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_254.wav|71|"It's all change on the music scene in Manchester."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_059.wav|22|It's the best of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_037.wav|99|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_012.wav|1|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_115.wav|102|There is no point in pushing it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_497.wav|75|He had planned to sell it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_415.wav|18|I didn't play badly.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_085.wav|102|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_446.wav|75|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_147.wav|81|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_389.wav|74|IT had to happen.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_211.wav|14|January is a bad time of year.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_125.wav|99|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_178.wav|15|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_284.wav|105|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_042.wav|57|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_339.wav|33|It's getting to me.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_278.wav|62|The past is history, not destiny.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_088.wav|52|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_054.wav|78|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_217.wav|25|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_010.wav|36|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_084.wav|53|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_258.wav|68|They have a very good method of working.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_407.wav|79|She failed to win any of them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_055.wav|99|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_398.wav|106|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_354.wav|85|We are doing okay in the league.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_002.wav|54|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_143.wav|54|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_208.wav|71|"I am delighted for Simon."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_044.wav|34|We've still got a say in this.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_024.wav|40|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_307.wav|69|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_054.wav|36|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_141.wav|94|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_182.wav|70|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_193.wav|67|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_318.wav|79|It doesn't look good for her.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_259.wav|36|You can never tell with the manager.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_127.wav|20|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_361.wav|50|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_079.wav|23|All the people thought that we would die.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_016.wav|89|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_005.wav|58|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_284.wav|52|The fans pay for their season tickets.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_037.wav|74|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
DUMMY2/p281/p281_095.wav|36|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_116.wav|107|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_426.wav|39|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_183.wav|17|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_382.wav|24|She is obviously very disappointed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_126.wav|88|The money all appears to be gone.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_021.wav|50|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_095.wav|52|He will be a very hard act to follow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_392.wav|21|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_368.wav|21|He is a visionary.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_218.wav|32|It was a crazy day.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_298.wav|29|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_174.wav|51|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_094.wav|61|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_372.wav|0|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_298.wav|21|It's the whole package.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_076.wav|37|I am relishing the challenge.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_040.wav|24|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_389.wav|97|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_131.wav|89|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_251.wav|68|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_158.wav|70|Words were not required.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_081.wav|27|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_232.wav|61|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_389.wav|14|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_281.wav|6|Then there was her childhood.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_334.wav|96|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_392.wav|107|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_259.wav|87|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_393.wav|19|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_085.wav|64|It was different from our other work.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_217.wav|27|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_234.wav|83|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p288/p288_275.wav|47|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_286.wav|20|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_124.wav|88|What can you say?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_010.wav|62|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_161.wav|57|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_054.wav|0|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_115.wav|107|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_232.wav|55|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_185.wav|100|I had too much to drink.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_463.wav|48|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_203.wav|52|Full details are expected to be released in June.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_341.wav|89|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_005.wav|86|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_074.wav|88|This was a massive result for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_269.wav|93|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_023.wav|90|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_385.wav|52|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_155.wav|56|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_198.wav|29|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_420.wav|36|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_102.wav|98|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_257.wav|101|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_112.wav|80|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_199.wav|32|He should emerge as the winner.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_058.wav|11|The net is closing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_242.wav|32|It will now be revived.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_349.wav|77|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_029.wav|25|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_385.wav|24|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_132.wav|18|We are still waiting.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_365.wav|26|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_246.wav|42|However we're capable of beating them.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_360.wav|87|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_176.wav|80|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_055.wav|87|I knew my contract was up this year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_076.wav|4|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_316.wav|51|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_270.wav|36|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_041.wav|53|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_278.wav|65|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_500.wav|48|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_062.wav|57|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_255.wav|75|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_301.wav|53|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_102.wav|76|There was no trouble at all.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_107.wav|34|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_059.wav|88|The family is so happy for him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_084.wav|91|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_131.wav|62|Frustration is not the word.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_121.wav|0|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_384.wav|25|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_242.wav|14|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_064.wav|62|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_053.wav|93|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_283.wav|65|She now lives in London.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_211.wav|48|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_281.wav|76|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_044.wav|81|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_306.wav|3|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_283.wav|5|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_358.wav|12|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_094.wav|100|All the pressure will be on him.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_042.wav|89|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_287.wav|30|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_177.wav|63|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_291.wav|36|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_268.wav|94|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_358.wav|103|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_254.wav|92|We're all involved in creating the work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_501.wav|75|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_059.wav|50|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_307.wav|15|Of course it is.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_288.wav|45|The mood is good.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_040.wav|101|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_124.wav|0|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_364.wav|65|They had to have hospital treatment.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_092.wav|28|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_264.wav|0|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_134.wav|21|I haven't been able to do it since.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_002.wav|79|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_115.wav|96|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_099.wav|93|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_243.wav|46|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_018.wav|2|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_313.wav|6|It will be very damaging for research.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_369.wav|22|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_194.wav|9|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_053.wav|54|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_163.wav|44|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_060.wav|56|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_333.wav|50|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_062.wav|28|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_248.wav|16|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_249.wav|71|"I am very angry."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_194.wav|29|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_310.wav|40|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_027.wav|49|I believe in the Church.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_018.wav|77|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_332.wav|74|People are using it in their daily lives.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_122.wav|52|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_061.wav|41|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_187.wav|89|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_254.wav|88|We can do it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_080.wav|47|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_337.wav|0|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_373.wav|11|This is not a struggle against Islam.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_175.wav|55|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_166.wav|99|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_394.wav|34|I want to go home.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_253.wav|101|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_156.wav|65|It gives a commitment.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_157.wav|37|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_224.wav|30|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_417.wav|85|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_414.wav|24|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_253.wav|79|It is not just the agencies.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_046.wav|84|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_394.wav|45|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_031.wav|22|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_385.wav|79|Father is on the train.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_083.wav|19|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_256.wav|93|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_157.wav|92|We must get the three points.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_286.wav|53|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_092.wav|70|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_343.wav|74|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_246.wav|88|I believe in having difficult times.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_179.wav|66|And does it?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_316.wav|41|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_274.wav|80|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_158.wav|53|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_081.wav|66|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_141.wav|104|He invented the language.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_074.wav|81|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_345.wav|105|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_284.wav|41|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_123.wav|100|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_105.wav|9|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_256.wav|1|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_019.wav|36|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_231.wav|85|Its future is uncertain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_377.wav|78|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_263.wav|39|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_403.wav|87|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_029.wav|72|I know my job.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_369.wav|85|It left me with sadness.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_341.wav|53|Put another way, they just won't do it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_328.wav|36|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_102.wav|4|Which he is, too.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_141.wav|18|It will be for the committee to decide.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_066.wav|7|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_207.wav|86|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_105.wav|18|We have been so lucky.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_273.wav|11|We can only do that for so long.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_065.wav|31|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_080.wav|97|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_174.wav|99|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_361.wav|91|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_373.wav|104|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_169.wav|52|We had to work very hard for our points.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_301.wav|51|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_145.wav|52|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_224.wav|27|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_071.wav|11|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_124.wav|25|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_266.wav|68|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_320.wav|62|It is not illegal.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_236.wav|12|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_373.wav|72|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_148.wav|12|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_208.wav|19|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_247.wav|10|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_233.wav|61|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_429.wav|36|John Daly has a burning ambition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_403.wav|106|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_432.wav|50|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_124.wav|27|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_380.wav|107|She was released from hospital yesterday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_012.wav|2|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_302.wav|38|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_262.wav|107|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_134.wav|65|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_334.wav|5|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_139.wav|56|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_025.wav|84|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_147.wav|6|I doubt it would be genuine.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_182.wav|100|I will be in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_077.wav|37|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_353.wav|28|And that gives a kind of freedom.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_233.wav|22|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_124.wav|67|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_308.wav|107|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_066.wav|52|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_153.wav|6|It has no chance.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_221.wav|97|Other people also tried.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_030.wav|101|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_398.wav|15|But don't just take my word, for it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_120.wav|99|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_105.wav|81|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_319.wav|59|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_292.wav|45|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_065.wav|10|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_286.wav|90|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_053.wav|59|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_290.wav|105|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_018.wav|82|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_203.wav|17|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_165.wav|17|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_436.wav|75|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_234.wav|49|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_363.wav|50|We live on an island.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_181.wav|10|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_037.wav|63|Costs have got to be controlled.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_300.wav|47|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_013.wav|68|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_245.wav|39|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_169.wav|83|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_394.wav|85|There may be hope this year, however.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_317.wav|12|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_063.wav|79|For that much we must be grateful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_035.wav|37|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_001.wav|92|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_211.wav|31|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_344.wav|3|We do not have the papers.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_191.wav|34|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_239.wav|101|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_067.wav|37|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_212.wav|44|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_415.wav|64|I want to win this thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_168.wav|23|So, easy does it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_120.wav|92|The whole thing in general is moving on.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_258.wav|21|It went on forever.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_078.wav|104|Subs not used, McGraw.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_047.wav|57|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_211.wav|78|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_359.wav|56|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_328.wav|104|There are so many unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_230.wav|7|January is a bad time of year.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_281.wav|44|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_312.wav|50|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_330.wav|68|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_377.wav|21|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_083.wav|28|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_346.wav|44|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_297.wav|60|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_329.wav|50|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_387.wav|58|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_339.wav|79|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_124.wav|45|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_223.wav|66|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_093.wav|74|The teenager had been missing for six months.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_376.wav|13|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_162.wav|27|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_293.wav|77|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_117.wav|80|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_331.wav|9|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_317.wav|105|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_160.wav|7|People were actually not on his side.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_255.wav|86|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_173.wav|92|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_298.wav|19|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_065.wav|35|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_367.wav|31|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_320.wav|69|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_072.wav|98|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_048.wav|17|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_162.wav|24|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_187.wav|83|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_275.wav|48|It's going to be very closely watched.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_054.wav|14|Italy is a beautiful place.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_090.wav|11|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_401.wav|48|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_264.wav|46|Players want to know what is on offer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_248.wav|48|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_211.wav|56|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_274.wav|87|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_305.wav|4|That was me today.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_383.wav|103|He added, however, that all options are under review.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_087.wav|83|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_350.wav|34|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_151.wav|58|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_141.wav|61|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_384.wav|76|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_125.wav|17|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_348.wav|10|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_099.wav|31|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_423.wav|18|Couldn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_045.wav|76|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_029.wav|66|The injuries are not too serious.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_404.wav|78|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_193.wav|86|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_124.wav|44|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_247.wav|31|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p262/p262_219.wav|45|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_458.wav|8|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_237.wav|61|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_138.wav|64|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_069.wav|61|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_174.wav|77|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_163.wav|18|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_348.wav|39|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_189.wav|85|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_157.wav|100|The bank was now involved.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_359.wav|84|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_382.wav|2|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_335.wav|48|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_116.wav|30|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_236.wav|53|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_021.wav|102|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_420.wav|16|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_014.wav|36|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_207.wav|41|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_249.wav|12|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_401.wav|75|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_172.wav|0|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_439.wav|7|There is a solution, she believes.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_285.wav|45|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_046.wav|64|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_048.wav|13|We suffered a lot for seven years.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_003.wav|67|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_234.wav|38|He took my breath away.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_252.wav|87|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_023.wav|69|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_212.wav|56|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_306.wav|88|Sub Not Used, McKee.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_285.wav|59|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_351.wav|33|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_127.wav|22|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_454.wav|48|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_390.wav|84|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_377.wav|14|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_149.wav|14|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_278.wav|86|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_138.wav|90|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_055.wav|17|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.

DUMMY2/p285/p285_391.wav|2|They are good.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_054.wav|38|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_401.wav|37|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_008.wav|79|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_099.wav|19|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_135.wav|11|The contest was already over.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_087.wav|63|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_349.wav|107|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_067.wav|21|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_145.wav|76|However, it's not all bad news for women.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_027.wav|83|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_248.wav|28|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_275.wav|101|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_065.wav|101|There is no pressure on us.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_109.wav|13|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_204.wav|96|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_193.wav|14|You know the sort of thing.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_063.wav|15|Policing the profession is important.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_184.wav|28|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_198.wav|79|It was just a feeling.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_063.wav|8|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_188.wav|1|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_392.wav|10|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_227.wav|7|The move follows a review of the Singapore)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_099.wav|42|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_212.wav|49|We are not ruling it out.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_248.wav|84|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_065.wav|20|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_341.wav|7|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_187.wav|17|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_285.wav|40|It was good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_096.wav|66|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_426.wav|32|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_333.wav|28|Many innocent people will die.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_181.wav|65|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_011.wav|42|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_259.wav|99|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_397.wav|47|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_331.wav|60|This plan is all about respect.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_391.wav|14|He will consult the right people.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_156.wav|30|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_389.wav|10|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_381.wav|18|He was at the outset of his career.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_145.wav|51|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_191.wav|41|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_029.wav|73|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_055.wav|40|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_170.wav|54|I got off to a great start.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_309.wav|66|They were the better side on the day.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_354.wav|101|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_254.wav|3|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_048.wav|54|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_250.wav|53|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_061.wav|86|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_054.wav|56|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_056.wav|82|We expect them to deliver for us.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_048.wav|69|We will push.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_236.wav|81|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_123.wav|59|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_243.wav|24|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_234.wav|72|We were desperate to get the game on.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_046.wav|28|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_316.wav|17|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_255.wav|44|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_321.wav|18|I would love to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_278.wav|91|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_247.wav|96|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_348.wav|73|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_201.wav|71|"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_415.wav|92|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_078.wav|56|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_006.wav|31|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_093.wav|0|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_269.wav|9|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_126.wav|59|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_332.wav|63|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_048.wav|52|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_286.wav|73|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_125.wav|13|Britain has never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_341.wav|72|There were many positives for this club.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_299.wav|85|I am quite excited about it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_076.wav|94|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_406.wav|89|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_155.wav|46|I certainly believe we can do it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_275.wav|77|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_050.wav|4|They are already on the way there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_333.wav|47|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_106.wav|33|We have no excuses.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_229.wav|32|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_155.wav|80|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_455.wav|24|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_038.wav|66|There is no escape.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_156.wav|60|No, we were not exactly favourites.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_090.wav|23|Will he be given time?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_259.wav|96|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_396.wav|75|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_027.wav|88|That would be a big step forward.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_078.wav|19|We are confident of taking that back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_274.wav|24|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_227.wav|49|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_052.wav|36|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_180.wav|34|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_044.wav|105|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_080.wav|92|People are already enjoying it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_130.wav|100|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_118.wav|39|It was won on the issue of the land.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_157.wav|81|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_047.wav|62|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_400.wav|78|It is the last meeting of the season.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_299.wav|63|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_333.wav|40|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_197.wav|10|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_034.wav|89|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_247.wav|71|"Chelsea was a great club."
DUMMY2/p360/p360_126.wav|60|Or was it?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_331.wav|68|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_324.wav|32|So what happens next ?)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_285.wav|66|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_167.wav|83|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_208.wav|6|That decision is now being appealed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_125.wav|78|We had a great time.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_051.wav|105|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_260.wav|93|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_243.wav|6|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_171.wav|37|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_141.wav|19|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_103.wav|101|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_418.wav|40|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_289.wav|26|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_326.wav|68|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_104.wav|44|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_164.wav|81|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_260.wav|28|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_132.wav|7|I am totally devoted to this job.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_012.wav|62|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_059.wav|73|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_400.wav|38|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_376.wav|7|Neither man has been charged.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_376.wav|17|So what does one do?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_034.wav|48|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_299.wav|100|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_357.wav|15|The programme was awful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_126.wav|40|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_191.wav|23|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_082.wav|1|I am here to play football.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_080.wav|87|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_201.wav|83|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_103.wav|32|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_153.wav|98|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_073.wav|90|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_365.wav|103|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_100.wav|67|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_060.wav|31|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_169.wav|77|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_222.wav|89|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_204.wav|102|Donald was a man with many friends.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_135.wav|66|Yet he chose to do something different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_310.wav|74|The difference was amazing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_143.wav|36|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_435.wav|37|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_366.wav|57|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_360.wav|72|It's a drop in the bucket.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_123.wav|73|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_205.wav|33|It's not a new device.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_196.wav|86|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_062.wav|31|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_203.wav|29|It was served by sheriff officers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_400.wav|26|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_337.wav|8|The next week is crucial.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_016.wav|87|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_025.wav|47|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_338.wav|28|It's our worst nightmare.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_368.wav|23|The men are safe and unharmed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_292.wav|60|I am in a good position.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_123.wav|22|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_215.wav|24|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_162.wav|38|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_004.wav|66|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_034.wav|83|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_276.wav|35|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_059.wav|26|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_315.wav|69|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_288.wav|98|Yet he remains confident enough.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_379.wav|21|The call was ignored.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_257.wav|48|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_179.wav|28|He didn't have long to wait.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_393.wav|46|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_271.wav|47|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_048.wav|3|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_072.wav|35|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_201.wav|61|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_461.wav|48|Inventories are coming under control.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_197.wav|59|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_333.wav|105|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_181.wav|105|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_169.wav|68|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_380.wav|47|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_243.wav|88|The car driver was not injured.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_052.wav|101|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_020.wav|43|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_004.wav|26|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_336.wav|25|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_419.wav|77|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_272.wav|54|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_391.wav|103|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_389.wav|2|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_408.wav|37|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_155.wav|25|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_014.wav|38|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_354.wav|91|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_145.wav|27|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_346.wav|4|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_416.wav|63|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_175.wav|90|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_317.wav|66|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_237.wav|51|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_401.wav|103|We are now open.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_167.wav|15|Not that he's declined.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_354.wav|104|We didn't mean to kill him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_130.wav|54|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_052.wav|10|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p258/p258_186.wav|26|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_106.wav|72|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_184.wav|43|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_418.wav|15|As indeed it did.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_118.wav|31|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_199.wav|63|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_146.wav|63|He will get his chances.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_239.wav|10|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_373.wav|51|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_353.wav|107|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_172.wav|11|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_347.wav|0|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_313.wav|23|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_175.wav|57|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_489.wav|65|That time may never be broken.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_083.wav|59|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_239.wav|97|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_033.wav|89|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_372.wav|85|It was our time maybe.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_279.wav|57|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_350.wav|83|That would help.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_273.wav|44|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_232.wav|22|That's the key issue isn't it?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_120.wav|58|You can see their point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_266.wav|20|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_247.wav|25|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_291.wav|19|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_358.wav|21|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_380.wav|60|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_407.wav|6|There's nothing she can't do.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_353.wav|94|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_336.wav|60|I am very happy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_221.wav|106|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_050.wav|71|"It has been a horrible, horrible time."
DUMMY2/p239/p239_004.wav|48|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_337.wav|26|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_163.wav|36|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_217.wav|7|This will be our new beginning.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_223.wav|79|We tried to get them down.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_067.wav|10|The fans would love it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_080.wav|5|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_286.wav|59|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_244.wav|28|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_071.wav|2|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_042.wav|63|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_112.wav|103|They could not hear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_034.wav|7|She is employed on short-term contracts.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_259.wav|57|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_027.wav|1|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_195.wav|17|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_116.wav|103|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_136.wav|47|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_415.wav|105|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_002.wav|67|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_187.wav|58|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_195.wav|7|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_417.wav|35|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_367.wav|75|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_149.wav|76|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_273.wav|33|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_002.wav|76|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_101.wav|58|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_112.wav|21|I would love to play in Europe again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_294.wav|72|He met his wife and married in England.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_313.wav|94|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_292.wav|67|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_312.wav|79|I knew him well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_370.wav|100|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_449.wav|50|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_377.wav|49|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_130.wav|75|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_398.wav|37|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_403.wav|56|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_277.wav|62|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_282.wav|32|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_323.wav|100|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_050.wav|43|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_296.wav|55|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_102.wav|107|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_020.wav|0|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_360.wav|1|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_241.wav|56|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_222.wav|29|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_030.wav|47|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_344.wav|64|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_356.wav|95|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_221.wav|84|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_327.wav|78|He is already in place.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_100.wav|92|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_405.wav|98|Is it any good?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_092.wav|53|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_076.wav|34|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_313.wav|62|And they did just that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_167.wav|85|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_070.wav|53|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_135.wav|62|But what lies ahead?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_109.wav|62|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_481.wav|65|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_140.wav|50|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_304.wav|12|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_016.wav|6|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_278.wav|7|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_297.wav|103|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_268.wav|9|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_406.wav|1|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_398.wav|14|It is a simple equation.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_162.wav|22|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_066.wav|68|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_276.wav|102|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_234.wav|46|There were two things going on at once.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_268.wav|35|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_255.wav|38|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_101.wav|104|It's annoying in a way.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_037.wav|104|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_238.wav|52|The children were later able to leave by bus.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_079.wav|53|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_082.wav|9|You will be.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_091.wav|43|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p245/p245_002.wav|59|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_336.wav|44|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_329.wav|96|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_191.wav|70|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_391.wav|100|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_050.wav|30|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_248.wav|25|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_393.wav|87|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_064.wav|35|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_039.wav|8|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_368.wav|96|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_399.wav|107|It remains in public ownership.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_220.wav|86|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_096.wav|55|Now comes the hard part.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_076.wav|36|There could be a lot of confusion.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_206.wav|79|We will be working on that this week, all right.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_170.wav|94|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_410.wav|104|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_225.wav|45|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_108.wav|6|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_384.wav|2|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_278.wav|104|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_103.wav|51|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_164.wav|88|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_097.wav|13|That, though, is an old story.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_414.wav|18|Now we must look to the future.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_148.wav|54|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_384.wav|77|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_012.wav|33|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_169.wav|42|I'm going to buy a car.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_039.wav|89|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_344.wav|20|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_313.wav|60|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_025.wav|62|Perhaps that was their mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_285.wav|89|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_309.wav|73|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_402.wav|78|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_457.wav|63|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_030.wav|5|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_036.wav|25|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_396.wav|107|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_026.wav|72|Who cares about that?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_318.wav|0|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_096.wav|53|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_051.wav|75|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_070.wav|18|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_049.wav|9|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_074.wav|54|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_418.wav|63|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_383.wav|11|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_373.wav|41|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_364.wav|0|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_069.wav|56|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_100.wav|12|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_087.wav|88|I support the stand that they are making.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_385.wav|34|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_250.wav|47|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_321.wav|5|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_274.wav|37|He is a right bastard.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_269.wav|16|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_266.wav|99|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_106.wav|27|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_076.wav|20|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_270.wav|37|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_152.wav|3|But it is different in different regions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_110.wav|32|We have a team to reach the final.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_095.wav|106|He's not getting into any games.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_122.wav|41|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_363.wav|79|It was up to him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_013.wav|27|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_127.wav|75|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_127.wav|47|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_144.wav|95|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_276.wav|21|She is a valuable member of Government.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_014.wav|79|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_210.wav|80|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_385.wav|74|That is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_404.wav|107|I leave tonight for England.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_271.wav|86|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_380.wav|32|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_198.wav|50|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_214.wav|58|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_110.wav|5|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_056.wav|88|Our commitment is to move forward.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_095.wav|32|It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_080.wav|67|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_219.wav|16|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_004.wav|95|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_027.wav|86|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_371.wav|67|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_122.wav|56|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_250.wav|38|Well, it's not before time, is it?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_101.wav|20|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_381.wav|54|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_229.wav|97|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_050.wav|33|Instead we were shot in the back.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_039.wav|103|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_201.wav|15|When it is ready, it will be signed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_226.wav|47|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_082.wav|30|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_309.wav|87|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_170.wav|6|So what's in store?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_279.wav|101|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_411.wav|56|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_124.wav|34|It will also take evidence from consumers.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_306.wav|30|We are determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_127.wav|17|Both offices were closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_241.wav|86|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_067.wav|49|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_027.wav|22|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_116.wav|85|This is totally untrue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_142.wav|81|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_195.wav|58|We've got a great defensive club.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_180.wav|107|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_339.wav|38|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_258.wav|71|"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_318.wav|45|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_257.wav|33|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_145.wav|3|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_078.wav|91|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_270.wav|39|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_323.wav|41|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_175.wav|69|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_045.wav|87|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_295.wav|17|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_387.wav|14|The team hadn't been picked.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_291.wav|80|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_314.wav|1|There's a lot of hysteria.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_126.wav|73|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_213.wav|31|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_215.wav|14|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_123.wav|53|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_184.wav|67|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_092.wav|0|They were a lovely couple.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_188.wav|91|I hope you miss the cut.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_131.wav|23|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_314.wav|8|Job losses were also announced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_349.wav|50|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_438.wav|89|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_191.wav|54|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_031.wav|20|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_307.wav|73|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_308.wav|43|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_015.wav|95|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_322.wav|48|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_268.wav|21|We are all suffering.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_162.wav|100|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_138.wav|85|The case was taken on by his brother.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_330.wav|47|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_245.wav|88|Colin Cameron was excellent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_405.wav|100|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_269.wav|28|It will not be a long campaign.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_255.wav|35|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_373.wav|49|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_312.wav|18|He did not report it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_069.wav|67|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_275.wav|23|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_267.wav|80|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_062.wav|51|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_168.wav|84|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_311.wav|52|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_353.wav|54|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_086.wav|56|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_338.wav|98|I was in tears in the street.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_148.wav|6|It would be a masterclass.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_030.wav|8|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_263.wav|9|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_260.wav|89|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_330.wav|4|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_076.wav|63|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_248.wav|70|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_202.wav|49|I looked forward to it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_393.wav|49|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_011.wav|97|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_103.wav|80|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_086.wav|97|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_339.wav|52|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_126.wav|2|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_323.wav|73|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_240.wav|48|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_256.wav|106|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_429.wav|40|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_092.wav|85|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_237.wav|93|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_259.wav|19|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_395.wav|82|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_016.wav|49|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_398.wav|69|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_142.wav|43|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_218.wav|64|Or some thought that they have.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_191.wav|95|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_203.wav|54|I think it was briefly considered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_008.wav|29|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_091.wav|14|We have to offer value for money.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_204.wav|99|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_110.wav|77|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_071.wav|10|It was a unanimous decision.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_108.wav|44|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_200.wav|95|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_153.wav|79|It has still to be recovered.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_189.wav|66|I've already done that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_384.wav|4|He didn't really, we just made that up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_215.wav|100|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_231.wav|70|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_116.wav|1|So, how will it be received in the US?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_211.wav|40|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_402.wav|94|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_277.wav|82|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_450.wav|63|We make this offer to the parliament.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_043.wav|76|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_389.wav|62|That's an old idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_372.wav|87|I have little time for analysts.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_185.wav|75|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_003.wav|88|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_369.wav|24|He had no access to the database.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_006.wav|10|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_098.wav|18|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_330.wav|42|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_262.wav|4|There are many questions to be answered.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_257.wav|24|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_305.wav|54|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_304.wav|22|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_035.wav|52|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_222.wav|58|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_371.wav|27|It seems a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_294.wav|19|That, though, is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_228.wav|93|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_133.wav|54|You can never have enough money.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_033.wav|28|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_312.wav|83|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_133.wav|90|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_083.wav|12|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_010.wav|58|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_074.wav|76|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_299.wav|106|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_072.wav|87|We deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_258.wav|88|We deserved to get the victory today.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_077.wav|73|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_357.wav|36|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_278.wav|60|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_243.wav|29|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_404.wav|14|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_391.wav|34|Later they changed their minds.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_438.wav|39|I can't wait for the season to end.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_119.wav|4|He decides to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_020.wav|107|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_287.wav|58|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_088.wav|10|But they must believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_253.wav|66|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_351.wav|85|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_140.wav|36|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_462.wav|8|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_062.wav|97|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_110.wav|74|That's the way it goes.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_209.wav|47|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_211.wav|64|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_103.wav|57|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_348.wav|11|We won't go down without a struggle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_222.wav|7|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_037.wav|72|We have a strong team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_054.wav|42|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_341.wav|38|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_387.wav|40|They are good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_198.wav|81|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_332.wav|1|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_008.wav|38|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_119.wav|98|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_109.wav|29|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_413.wav|17|People ask about the concept of a team.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_181.wav|30|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_034.wav|94|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_260.wav|107|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_299.wav|40|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_381.wav|25|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_114.wav|5|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_225.wav|41|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_251.wav|102|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_027.wav|16|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_028.wav|57|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_001.wav|0|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_098.wav|59|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_391.wav|27|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_110.wav|60|They offered to make an investment into it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_338.wav|42|That was one very hard game.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_068.wav|24|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_140.wav|22|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_157.wav|3|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_070.wav|2|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_215.wav|64|This is a foolish idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_091.wav|87|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_284.wav|1|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_147.wav|46|Too many factors are now working against him.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_246.wav|107|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_300.wav|29|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_379.wav|66|I didn't do too badly myself.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_135.wav|53|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_480.wav|7|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_398.wav|42|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_013.wav|20|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_280.wav|14|Scotland won by six wickets.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_295.wav|71|"It became a book by itself."
DUMMY2/p310/p310_038.wav|17|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_412.wav|64|I have not come in to take over.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_375.wav|47|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_289.wav|54|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_075.wav|91|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_235.wav|8|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_128.wav|92|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_286.wav|27|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_287.wav|68|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_350.wav|77|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_194.wav|106|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_478.wav|65|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_399.wav|0|That's all I can say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_061.wav|97|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_183.wav|72|This is it finally finished.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_293.wav|69|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_304.wav|10|John was there already in spirit.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_464.wav|100|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_031.wav|85|Naturally, she said yes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_151.wav|84|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_205.wav|27|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_020.wav|40|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_403.wav|20|So I did.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_005.wav|74|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_381.wav|74|There was no question of him not impressing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_340.wav|17|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_209.wav|103|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_207.wav|54|It's part of the game, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_133.wav|71|"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_285.wav|23|They feel it belongs to them.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_068.wav|16|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_231.wav|107|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_226.wav|59|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p333/p333_261.wav|64|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_093.wav|65|Are you going to win?)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_059.wav|6|That is our objective.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_263.wav|12|That means no more taxation by stealth.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_137.wav|88|Destruction came from within.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_123.wav|37|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_069.wav|70|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_285.wav|91|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_357.wav|102|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_029.wav|91|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_300.wav|4|It would have to be backdated.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_257.wav|28|We would expect it to disappear in time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_174.wav|30|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_352.wav|93|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_197.wav|20|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_163.wav|69|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_189.wav|35|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_221.wav|40|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_306.wav|77|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_345.wav|62|Then came the second round.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_076.wav|75|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_155.wav|98|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_116.wav|67|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_225.wav|15|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_187.wav|75|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_060.wav|73|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_058.wav|103|I have had no social life at all.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_242.wav|9|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_354.wav|86|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_160.wav|30|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_417.wav|39|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_239.wav|41|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_062.wav|91|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_343.wav|4|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_003.wav|80|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_216.wav|48|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_081.wav|60|Nothing is going right at the moment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_019.wav|100|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_116.wav|0|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_036.wav|38|We could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_403.wav|25|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_039.wav|94|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_262.wav|5|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_370.wav|20|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_210.wav|99|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_328.wav|83|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_287.wav|99|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_232.wav|41|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_084.wav|18|There is no change in the strategy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_177.wav|47|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_069.wav|102|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_218.wav|16|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_275.wav|32|He is quite well organised.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_246.wav|92|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_252.wav|10|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_240.wav|93|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_117.wav|58|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_191.wav|45|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_083.wav|11|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_343.wav|107|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_394.wav|92|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_266.wav|26|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_253.wav|83|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_129.wav|42|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_355.wav|92|He is very much in our thoughts.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_098.wav|1|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_058.wav|107|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_115.wav|80|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_001.wav|88|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_341.wav|79|And we are doing it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_152.wav|50|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_331.wav|45|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_174.wav|88|This has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_077.wav|27|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_371.wav|33|Frustration is not the word.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_389.wav|68|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_162.wav|87|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_086.wav|10|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_357.wav|52|It is the only natural British site on the list.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_208.wav|0|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_020.wav|75|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_046.wav|12|We will continue to operate within the sport.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_228.wav|20|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_304.wav|72|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_003.wav|86|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_276.wav|107|We've turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_466.wav|100|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_078.wav|68|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_378.wav|103|I see no reason for them to be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_128.wav|28|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_149.wav|92|I can't say that this is very usual.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_389.wav|79|I think it was entirely the right decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_185.wav|92|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_382.wav|32|Both of those promises have already been honoured.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_303.wav|78|We have to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_260.wav|41|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_175.wav|31|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_283.wav|79|But it's the truth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_191.wav|82|It's not only my respect for them.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_409.wav|103|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_301.wav|55|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_038.wav|89|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_282.wav|49|Arsenal considered the job done.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_372.wav|16|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_392.wav|52|Five years ago its return was rejected.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_152.wav|5|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_231.wav|25|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_049.wav|46|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_130.wav|24|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_247.wav|63|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_305.wav|10|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_118.wav|8|You were made to feel so welcome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_029.wav|8|It was as if I had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_187.wav|82|It's all too early.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_181.wav|9|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_045.wav|70|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_214.wav|33|No decision has yet been made.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_072.wav|19|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_206.wav|13|The next one comes up.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_084.wav|104|It is a very genuine prospect.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_017.wav|71|"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "
DUMMY2/p263/p263_105.wav|39|The investment will be in the food.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_397.wav|106|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_304.wav|63|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_026.wav|94|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_297.wav|52|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_018.wav|79|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_285.wav|48|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_225.wav|98|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_087.wav|104|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_396.wav|78|I understand the frustration of the fans.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_147.wav|70|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_048.wav|100|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_256.wav|33|The old manager, he didn't like me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_103.wav|24|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_223.wav|34|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_413.wav|4|We haven't been told.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_272.wav|94|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_004.wav|4|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_369.wav|27|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_022.wav|18|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_268.wav|15|I want to concentrate on the real issues.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_066.wav|0|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_091.wav|24|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_308.wav|52|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_337.wav|97|I was not a joiner.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_177.wav|41|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_138.wav|81|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_230.wav|32|The performance continues to improve.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_306.wav|34|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_316.wav|14|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_311.wav|82|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_415.wav|42|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_340.wav|24|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_249.wav|82|It is understood he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_171.wav|84|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_387.wav|68|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_009.wav|99|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_397.wav|103|It brings together two essential elements.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_309.wav|76|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_420.wav|15|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_261.wav|26|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_249.wav|95|This is an exciting time for the party.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_228.wav|57|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_350.wav|104|There were no violations.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_331.wav|33|That has not been the case, as we now know.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_081.wav|91|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_106.wav|20|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_302.wav|78|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_370.wav|8|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_023.wav|71|"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "
DUMMY2/p275/p275_426.wav|40|I want a career.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_301.wav|28|English is the language of pop music.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_175.wav|96|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_226.wav|31|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_049.wav|100|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_203.wav|88|I've got nothing to say.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_346.wav|41|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_026.wav|104|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_270.wav|10|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_188.wav|96|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_364.wav|60|That gives it a spirit.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_323.wav|107|I'm getting long in the tooth.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_069.wav|40|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_379.wav|75|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_007.wav|76|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_330.wav|74|Let's make him a show.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_153.wav|25|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_380.wav|14|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_172.wav|98|It could last five months.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_270.wav|63|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_013.wav|0|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_082.wav|69|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_322.wav|14|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_046.wav|18|That is not the place for her.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_364.wav|100|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_306.wav|48|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_243.wav|5|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_372.wav|20|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_024.wav|42|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_298.wav|95|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_196.wav|59|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_014.wav|57|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_418.wav|98|It is my decision and my decision alone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_274.wav|66|So there's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_274.wav|58|We have got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_198.wav|91|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_307.wav|46|That is where the club has gone wrong.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_396.wav|104|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_315.wav|1|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_420.wav|11|It feels like too much.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_291.wav|13|For that much we must be grateful.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_242.wav|65|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_023.wav|78|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_346.wav|0|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_144.wav|71|"The idea is simple."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_355.wav|34|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_098.wav|102|There are a huge number of arts.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_334.wav|101|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_188.wav|45|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_292.wav|29|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_224.wav|59|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_122.wav|13|It certainly should not be used too often.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_159.wav|104|You've been working for four years.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_237.wav|62|We must not give in to the bastards.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_195.wav|64|There was no happy ending.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_404.wav|7|This remains the party's policy.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_331.wav|86|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_004.wav|3|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_249.wav|11|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_012.wav|30|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_169.wav|13|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_098.wav|67|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_159.wav|106|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_223.wav|44|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_361.wav|38|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_013.wav|4|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_286.wav|97|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_155.wav|105|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_174.wav|83|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_094.wav|39|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_064.wav|21|He has really done well.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_054.wav|27|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_056.wav|46|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_392.wav|46|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_168.wav|6|We have been together for five years.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_133.wav|34|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_292.wav|15|I have never felt so well.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_188.wav|78|That is a question for the next manager.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_229.wav|68|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_317.wav|94|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p260/p260_220.wav|81|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_237.wav|19|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_390.wav|92|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_347.wav|34|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_122.wav|99|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_231.wav|43|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_325.wav|57|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_222.wav|71|"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_114.wav|105|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_347.wav|77|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_391.wav|36|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_100.wav|55|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_308.wav|66|We have to adapt to this level.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_317.wav|27|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_229.wav|90|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_214.wav|14|I had relied on him.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_284.wav|55|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_405.wav|107|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_184.wav|55|It is actually building on the existing business.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_326.wav|77|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_181.wav|42|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_275.wav|56|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_223.wav|72|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_301.wav|93|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_263.wav|38|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_342.wav|59|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_138.wav|13|Elections would follow in about two years.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_368.wav|45|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_167.wav|58|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_443.wav|37|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_025.wav|104|They were the better team on the night.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_321.wav|107|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_387.wav|70|They are good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_347.wav|89|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_148.wav|92|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_186.wav|75|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_186.wav|48|That was just one night.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_413.wav|63|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_082.wav|106|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_199.wav|43|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_207.wav|22|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_101.wav|29|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_343.wav|34|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_262.wav|37|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_031.wav|72|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_314.wav|90|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_225.wav|24|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_272.wav|8|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_086.wav|43|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_056.wav|105|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_293.wav|88|I know we ask a lot of you.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_195.wav|9|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_360.wav|21|The tribunal continues today.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_135.wav|45|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_286.wav|25|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_107.wav|25|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_037.wav|31|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_307.wav|40|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_198.wav|0|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_286.wav|50|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_407.wav|56|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_352.wav|62|And she's not even in the book!
DUMMY2/p226/p226_078.wav|43|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_012.wav|6|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_016.wav|95|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_318.wav|31|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_254.wav|6|We stopped at half-time.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_229.wav|82|It will be all about the Olympics.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_152.wav|67|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_207.wav|107|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_135.wav|107|The European Court is our only option.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_218.wav|46|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_105.wav|24|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_179.wav|88|But he did not rule out further talks.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_132.wav|69|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_261.wav|94|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_153.wav|46|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_176.wav|8|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_367.wav|6|She had not suffered any physical injury.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_296.wav|87|They need to be involved.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_258.wav|11|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_144.wav|62|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_303.wav|11|I've already got this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_016.wav|34|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_019.wav|12|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_247.wav|87|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_360.wav|103|No, is the answer to your first question.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_379.wav|87|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_011.wav|102|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_152.wav|57|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_316.wav|31|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_364.wav|78|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_219.wav|15|This plan is an agenda for action.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_108.wav|38|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_018.wav|15|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_020.wav|19|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_005.wav|20|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_110.wav|46|It needs somebody to give way.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_277.wav|57|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_292.wav|57|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_136.wav|42|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_085.wav|97|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_261.wav|75|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_348.wav|34|The auction will be held tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_124.wav|101|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_024.wav|96|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_387.wav|95|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_419.wav|42|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_210.wav|19|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_399.wav|97|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_340.wav|68|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_148.wav|63|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_392.wav|49|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_143.wav|45|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_030.wav|53|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_411.wav|98|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_184.wav|75|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_085.wav|35|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_265.wav|60|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_318.wav|33|He had no access to the database.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_178.wav|3|I was always in control.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_285.wav|15|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_459.wav|24|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_201.wav|13|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_368.wav|25|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_436.wav|36|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_270.wav|20|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_019.wav|80|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_166.wav|107|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_147.wav|7|Does the name matter ?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_265.wav|86|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_233.wav|81|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_021.wav|37|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_037.wav|3|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_208.wav|10|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_198.wav|100|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_007.wav|39|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_061.wav|42|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_295.wav|79|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_308.wav|88|They were very responsive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_122.wav|89|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_299.wav|83|It could work.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_286.wav|107|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_132.wav|3|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_385.wav|105|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_279.wav|80|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_316.wav|81|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_235.wav|63|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_296.wav|100|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_126.wav|23|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_054.wav|35|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_093.wav|29|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_094.wav|99|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_361.wav|65|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_260.wav|9|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_293.wav|95|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_086.wav|102|I have made good progress.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_308.wav|78|Every character was completely different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_351.wav|17|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_248.wav|52|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_028.wav|55|He does not even trust his own members.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_073.wav|28|The Insider opens tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_422.wav|85|We won very easily.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_018.wav|33|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_016.wav|69|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_215.wav|48|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_039.wav|95|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_236.wav|52|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_181.wav|63|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_247.wav|47|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_163.wav|71|"He's been the key to everything."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_279.wav|89|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_315.wav|34|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_127.wav|79|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_307.wav|48|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_107.wav|39|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_412.wav|15|We're going to rebuild.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_141.wav|82|I don't have any perspective on it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_358.wav|63|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_329.wav|15|The process itself has taken over.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_224.wav|26|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_004.wav|104|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_237.wav|15|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_259.wav|74|The game will be at a football stadium.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_077.wav|63|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_320.wav|68|I am proud of those guys.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_343.wav|26|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_381.wav|27|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_335.wav|104|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_014.wav|20|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_105.wav|57|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_254.wav|84|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_190.wav|76|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_108.wav|56|I didn't think so either.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_088.wav|76|This could be her way forward.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_147.wav|103|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_007.wav|72|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_103.wav|10|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_129.wav|53|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_017.wav|92|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_346.wav|50|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_119.wav|97|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_064.wav|9|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_278.wav|50|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_407.wav|38|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_383.wav|63|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_467.wav|14|They're just a good retailer.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_156.wav|15|He is having a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_110.wav|62|I thought that all musicians were the same.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_132.wav|32|I feel very grateful with everything.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_039.wav|61|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_122.wav|47|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_390.wav|96|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_191.wav|17|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_241.wav|26|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_366.wav|24|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_182.wav|21|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_318.wav|80|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_105.wav|93|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_433.wav|65|He doesn't need to hit people.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_012.wav|22|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_219.wav|47|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_149.wav|57|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_031.wav|44|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_041.wav|0|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_117.wav|100|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_360.wav|98|Its future is no longer in question.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_386.wav|4|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_288.wav|16|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_151.wav|27|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_042.wav|103|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_387.wav|7|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_354.wav|25|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_068.wav|56|The creditors have lost a lot.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_347.wav|18|I don't want to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_109.wav|38|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_187.wav|107|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_392.wav|96|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_398.wav|46|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_082.wav|82|It is a freedom.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_022.wav|0|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_256.wav|38|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_326.wav|23|It possibly depends on the position.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_387.wav|60|They're all doing it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_400.wav|1|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_117.wav|22|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_203.wav|28|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_105.wav|67|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_052.wav|51|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_283.wav|11|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_307.wav|83|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_232.wav|87|Years ago it was really quite simple.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_024.wav|20|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_219.wav|3|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_362.wav|74|He said nothing of the sort.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_180.wav|43|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_206.wav|42|From day one, we were a family.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_164.wav|83|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_407.wav|107|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_354.wav|65|Both watched her win yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_402.wav|79|It's a dead end.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_068.wav|85|This is far too high.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_159.wav|12|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_052.wav|42|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_301.wav|43|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_208.wav|25|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_288.wav|100|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_028.wav|95|The idea is not new.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_056.wav|45|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_395.wav|77|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_377.wav|0|People are on the alert.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_126.wav|54|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_169.wav|47|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_238.wav|48|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_254.wav|24|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_034.wav|18|I want somebody with something to prove.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_138.wav|18|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_136.wav|10|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_216.wav|105|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_010.wav|0|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_334.wav|107|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_140.wav|77|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_338.wav|31|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_368.wav|27|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_059.wav|44|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_214.wav|65|Three hit the target.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_064.wav|49|This must be wrong.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_280.wav|54|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_386.wav|1|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_243.wav|89|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_255.wav|91|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_055.wav|55|I think I'm a bit too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_023.wav|37|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_368.wav|60|Having done it, he was asked again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_388.wav|69|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_010.wav|11|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_340.wav|3|That is always a problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_251.wav|48|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_342.wav|24|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_283.wav|100|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_156.wav|91|But you can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_081.wav|104|They could not have done more for me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_279.wav|100|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_019.wav|40|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_029.wav|58|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_094.wav|88|They have not seen her for years.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_342.wav|46|Britain is a peaceful nation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_132.wav|34|This will have no effect on the championship.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_009.wav|52|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_060.wav|83|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_350.wav|79|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_111.wav|27|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_319.wav|31|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_278.wav|80|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_324.wav|106|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_098.wav|52|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_256.wav|99|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_067.wav|60|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_405.wav|49|You name it, they have it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_127.wav|76|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_002.wav|49|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_398.wav|11|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_116.wav|48|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_311.wav|76|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_295.wav|25|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_269.wav|19|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_375.wav|77|SE is well down that road.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_426.wav|95|No date has been set for a meeting.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_364.wav|17|It is a decision which has paid off.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_034.wav|14|The company did not declare a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_028.wav|83|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_357.wav|17|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_328.wav|59|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_204.wav|77|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_276.wav|10|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_250.wav|56|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_130.wav|98|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_007.wav|86|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_264.wav|77|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_464.wav|75|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_396.wav|66|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_445.wav|37|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_267.wav|81|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_277.wav|37|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_052.wav|72|She was only doing her job.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_247.wav|64|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_224.wav|96|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_304.wav|73|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_082.wav|101|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_326.wav|39|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_407.wav|40|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_035.wav|44|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_254.wav|43|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_267.wav|13|Just what we didn't need.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_209.wav|92|We need to know more about her.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_346.wav|97|A decision is expected next March.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_351.wav|3|His concern is only for the future.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_365.wav|100|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_446.wav|36|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_226.wav|32|William Hague delighted his party.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_096.wav|98|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_364.wav|77|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_204.wav|80|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_114.wav|37|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_223.wav|87|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_222.wav|106|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_319.wav|92|There's a good chance of seeing something.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_177.wav|85|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_274.wav|11|He got very close tonight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_251.wav|19|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_216.wav|54|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_395.wav|16|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_311.wav|29|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_357.wav|92|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_408.wav|64|There's nothing for you here.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_251.wav|46|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_292.wav|84|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_144.wav|94|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_367.wav|38|This was a chilling echo.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_037.wav|91|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_221.wav|24|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_174.wav|89|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_152.wav|42|I will go out with him any time.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_195.wav|102|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_098.wav|21|I am not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_320.wav|36|Scotland has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_254.wav|5|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_394.wav|17|There was only one hole in it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_195.wav|12|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_041.wav|55|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_411.wav|48|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_101.wav|42|That gives it a spirit.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_065.wav|60|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_304.wav|4|We have worked well with them for years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_392.wav|6|It has been a massive success.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_274.wav|9|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_284.wav|91|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_312.wav|37|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_111.wav|22|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_362.wav|51|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_364.wav|83|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_369.wav|66|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_002.wav|69|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_039.wav|60|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_163.wav|24|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_191.wav|58|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_043.wav|29|I'd come back from London.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_222.wav|98|The warnings were a good reminder.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_242.wav|38|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_340.wav|27|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_377.wav|76|She's currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_097.wav|103|Drugs are always an issue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_260.wav|22|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_064.wav|76|I learned a lot from that.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_380.wav|0|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_214.wav|85|I am really sorry that he is going.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_193.wav|45|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_157.wav|68|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_047.wav|23|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_341.wav|82|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_087.wav|21|No one was listening.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_010.wav|42|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_170.wav|34|The stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_096.wav|80|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_256.wav|12|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_362.wav|4|I hope he would have been very pleased.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_176.wav|104|You have to go to the edges.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_197.wav|89|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_148.wav|65|Do I think about them often?)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_281.wav|74|One thing is clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_024.wav|24|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_284.wav|87|Injuries have taken their toll.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_126.wav|21|It has been a great day.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_412.wav|79|He is very sensitive.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_314.wav|99|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_036.wav|26|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_262.wav|99|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_290.wav|71|"A new school will be built."
DUMMY2/p265/p265_135.wav|73|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_087.wav|23|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_103.wav|20|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_238.wav|13|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_183.wav|103|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_291.wav|105|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_022.wav|33|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_005.wav|43|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_052.wav|35|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_190.wav|5|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_146.wav|77|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_199.wav|107|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_039.wav|42|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_211.wav|5|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_066.wav|61|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_105.wav|51|That would be even more disastrous.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_119.wav|34|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_086.wav|2|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_115.wav|49|But it will backfire.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_406.wav|104|It was very well received.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_112.wav|17|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_263.wav|49|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_281.wav|97|I think we're very different.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_046.wav|68|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_403.wav|64|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_131.wav|88|That's why he is a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_374.wav|78|However, it does not seem to be the case.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_296.wav|101|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_025.wav|95|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_006.wav|103|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_132.wav|21|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_317.wav|35|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_209.wav|87|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_055.wav|41|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_231.wav|74|They have already done that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_287.wav|29|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_344.wav|10|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_295.wav|62|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_080.wav|18|What is the Barnett formula?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_004.wav|86|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_143.wav|67|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_275.wav|76|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_310.wav|98|That was me today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_494.wav|65|That means a ban on French products.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_236.wav|9|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_310.wav|69|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_378.wav|15|SO, that is it for another year.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_332.wav|86|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_025.wav|6|It's never been to committee.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_123.wav|15|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_039.wav|52|She will get through it I'm sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_131.wav|107|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_321.wav|83|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_107.wav|62|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_394.wav|52|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_226.wav|102|I found a fault and it worked at it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_073.wav|38|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_386.wav|14|The pair are very much in love.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_413.wav|78|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_327.wav|39|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_382.wav|51|There is a job to be done.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_054.wav|34|I don't think it is a drawback.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_077.wav|49|It's just for me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_306.wav|69|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_127.wav|95|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_387.wav|98|It's unusual to say the least.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_364.wav|23|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_232.wav|96|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_166.wav|104|There's been a mistake.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_128.wav|97|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_221.wav|53|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_219.wav|79|This has gone on too long.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_381.wav|38|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_304.wav|107|The snipers are also out.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_240.wav|15|They've got to get better.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_351.wav|6|Secondly, there is the question of money.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_102.wav|41|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_075.wav|48|Let's not be too despondent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_365.wav|77|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_022.wav|44|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_430.wav|50|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_346.wav|65|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_190.wav|75|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_369.wav|14|It is a stroke of genius.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_210.wav|52|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_185.wav|51|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_038.wav|26|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_360.wav|84|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_188.wav|65|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_112.wav|54|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_030.wav|36|They've got their own agenda.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_313.wav|89|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_243.wav|51|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_236.wav|75|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_383.wav|53|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_004.wav|41|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_263.wav|42|But something has been lost in the translation.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_444.wav|36|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_236.wav|56|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_153.wav|29|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_250.wav|2|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_380.wav|37|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_384.wav|48|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_172.wav|20|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_123.wav|30|Do not go into government buildings.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_271.wav|37|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_384.wav|96|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_079.wav|82|He would have loved it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_222.wav|3|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_004.wav|29|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_258.wav|101|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_099.wav|34|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_004.wav|6|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_129.wav|105|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_299.wav|25|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_261.wav|57|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_319.wav|101|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_332.wav|0|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_370.wav|103|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_303.wav|75|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_284.wav|71|"He was obviously very genuine."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_339.wav|45|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_188.wav|10|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_364.wav|63|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_305.wav|47|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_375.wav|0|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_166.wav|5|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_065.wav|50|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_078.wav|81|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_091.wav|29|That is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_317.wav|61|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_344.wav|85|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_096.wav|71|"It was mayhem."
DUMMY2/p334/p334_281.wav|38|They'll have to pay more.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_050.wav|98|It's the same with cinema.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_334.wav|14|And he goes with it.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_172.wav|43|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_140.wav|55|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_257.wav|29|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_042.wav|66|I fell into it by accident.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_149.wav|43|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_139.wav|34|I can give no comment.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_318.wav|57|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_094.wav|17|I agree with them.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_251.wav|60|Did he just want to be on telly?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_105.wav|53|I bought a flat six years ago.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_182.wav|36|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_011.wav|51|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_307.wav|106|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_308.wav|105|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_191.wav|102|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_182.wav|79|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_329.wav|46|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_086.wav|12|I have made good progress.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_193.wav|43|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_053.wav|105|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_052.wav|14|The couple actually came upon the accident.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_395.wav|92|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_105.wav|85|I would just like someone to confess.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_263.wav|89|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_398.wav|8|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_169.wav|74|It has been a waste of time.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_331.wav|34|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_093.wav|99|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p313/p313_174.wav|76|Dewar is the medium.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_173.wav|49|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_084.wav|8|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_280.wav|50|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_036.wav|30|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_048.wav|11|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_330.wav|75|I didn't have the reply.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_272.wav|60|Players have to accept this.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_347.wav|83|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_104.wav|29|And the match was not too bad, either.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_291.wav|40|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_234.wav|66|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_307.wav|14|But it has been an amazing experience.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_351.wav|0|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_161.wav|50|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_108.wav|12|You either have him or you don't.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_076.wav|45|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_226.wav|15|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_113.wav|3|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_065.wav|8|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_221.wav|87|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_064.wav|11|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_327.wav|9|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_296.wav|59|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_365.wav|86|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_253.wav|19|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_292.wav|87|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_331.wav|107|I'd go to bookshops.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_297.wav|62|It is highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_330.wav|57|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_374.wav|38|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_200.wav|2|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_210.wav|107|I was surprised by his response.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_134.wav|83|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_216.wav|88|It's better to be happy.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_238.wav|42|He's a sort of mystery figure.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_058.wav|31|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_070.wav|97|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_068.wav|64|John was a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_140.wav|68|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_422.wav|72|I will go out with him any time.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_254.wav|29|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_025.wav|10|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_401.wav|8|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_106.wav|67|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_062.wav|70|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_349.wav|28|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_341.wav|13|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_271.wav|2|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_020.wav|84|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_407.wav|77|I decided to take my time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_304.wav|45|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_303.wav|77|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_111.wav|11|We were never told it was already decided.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_127.wav|0|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_002.wav|21|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_186.wav|46|I learned a lot from that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_366.wav|79|And that was just about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_279.wav|97|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_270.wav|14|Does that put pressure on us ?)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_416.wav|33|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_334.wav|10|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_149.wav|83|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_189.wav|74|Yet it seemed to work.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_359.wav|11|It's a good start.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_100.wav|84|It should be a condition of employment.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_180.wav|87|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_311.wav|41|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_388.wav|24|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_213.wav|68|They should also have the right to vote.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_400.wav|70|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_210.wav|33|If only the problems concerned the players.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_088.wav|41|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_117.wav|102|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_146.wav|45|We should be clear about the role of government.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_061.wav|79|As good as they come.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_257.wav|40|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_452.wav|50|Its future is no longer in question.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_175.wav|64|He just carried on filming.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_368.wav|13|That's why he is a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_268.wav|12|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_051.wav|98|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_328.wav|32|There was no hint of scandal.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_138.wav|62|There was a definite prejudice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_171.wav|74|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_104.wav|47|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_280.wav|3|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_161.wav|58|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_213.wav|45|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_015.wav|78|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_092.wav|83|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_076.wav|65|The deal was done on Wednesday.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_240.wav|87|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_099.wav|16|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_102.wav|9|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_094.wav|1|He needed seven hours of surgery.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_147.wav|45|It is a freedom.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_042.wav|105|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_402.wav|62|She died later on Monday.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_218.wav|97|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_220.wav|15|It was all relative.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_217.wav|18|The acting left a lot to be desired.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_299.wav|8|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_125.wav|83|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_175.wav|73|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_107.wav|46|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_066.wav|99|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_319.wav|95|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_331.wav|19|Everyone is too upset to comment.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_150.wav|2|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_378.wav|18|They still have a great sense of humour.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_129.wav|100|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_204.wav|6|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_335.wav|65|It's quite crucial for me.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_120.wav|105|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_053.wav|20|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_182.wav|85|It was the same with the Dickens.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_086.wav|107|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_343.wav|39|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_158.wav|106|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_003.wav|3|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_411.wav|6|He died in September.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_218.wav|98|We have been through this with the lawyers.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_181.wav|20|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_178.wav|0|The referee had a good game.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_188.wav|68|Glasgow then took control.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_308.wav|41|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_246.wav|43|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_150.wav|107|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_148.wav|102|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_419.wav|17|It would show them a positive way forward.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_056.wav|84|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_361.wav|57|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_271.wav|50|I thought he might have been a bit.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_178.wav|42|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_059.wav|11|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_138.wav|45|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_215.wav|105|It's just a place to open it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_184.wav|76|He quit in October.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_103.wav|21|It is all in the mind.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_190.wav|70|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_321.wav|48|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_007.wav|83|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_270.wav|99|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_144.wav|17|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_240.wav|40|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_238.wav|85|He had a great game.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_029.wav|97|I am not a fan of stoppages.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_054.wav|79|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_375.wav|79|There are no quick fixes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_002.wav|28|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_118.wav|73|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_027.wav|106|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_388.wav|13|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_251.wav|26|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_357.wav|93|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_031.wav|103|I had found my vision.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_040.wav|87|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_150.wav|81|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_181.wav|15|That was the finest moment in my career.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_115.wav|58|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_168.wav|70|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_365.wav|91|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_390.wav|19|I may think about performing it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_233.wav|88|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_197.wav|60|Here it was very subdued.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_413.wav|8|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_361.wav|36|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_204.wav|52|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_252.wav|15|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_314.wav|29|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_131.wav|66|You can see their point.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_207.wav|76|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_028.wav|73|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_323.wav|6|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_358.wav|86|That would help.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_135.wav|90|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_149.wav|71|"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_289.wav|21|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_154.wav|79|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_164.wav|0|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_282.wav|65|Friday night was a pretty good night.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_031.wav|26|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_215.wav|52|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_087.wav|12|We do need a new one.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_349.wav|39|It is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_018.wav|90|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_109.wav|70|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_223.wav|73|I can leave at the end of the day.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_117.wav|107|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_353.wav|56|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_152.wav|95|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_089.wav|74|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_031.wav|91|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_327.wav|77|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_199.wav|35|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_062.wav|106|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_346.wav|100|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_145.wav|107|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_352.wav|94|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_181.wav|1|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_233.wav|105|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_248.wav|21|He had a great game.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_326.wav|81|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_157.wav|49|It's because they can't understand the language.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_147.wav|17|I've so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_169.wav|81|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_110.wav|14|Before the game we went for a pint.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_226.wav|10|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_345.wav|78|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_297.wav|50|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_396.wav|63|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_302.wav|106|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_146.wav|43|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_390.wav|42|And who would argue with that?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_345.wav|70|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_004.wav|16|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_388.wav|53|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_061.wav|7|The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_223.wav|49|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_066.wav|35|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_306.wav|74|Sub Not Used, McCall.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_047.wav|16|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_372.wav|32|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_357.wav|83|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_019.wav|69|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_239.wav|75|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_007.wav|92|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_278.wav|32|Quality was high in all sections.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_056.wav|35|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_289.wav|76|I'm not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_013.wav|86|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_406.wav|15|He added that he felt undermined.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_193.wav|34|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_265.wav|96|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_261.wav|77|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_232.wav|105|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_248.wav|54|They had had time for little else.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_072.wav|59|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_132.wav|73|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_167.wav|75|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_044.wav|29|If I was a woman.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_183.wav|5|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_221.wav|98|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_357.wav|40|That would help.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_442.wav|50|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_337.wav|24|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_126.wav|43|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_134.wav|26|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_112.wav|6|I sit at home a lot.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_156.wav|5|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_042.wav|1|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_163.wav|41|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_129.wav|4|The hearing was continued until a later date.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_224.wav|77|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_396.wav|37|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_368.wav|64|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_216.wav|102|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_230.wav|49|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_255.wav|22|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_043.wav|65|I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_258.wav|64|There are a few changes.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_344.wav|78|And the context is also completely different.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_071.wav|107|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_062.wav|67|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_400.wav|68|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_324.wav|8|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_403.wav|50|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_157.wav|0|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_456.wav|75|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_138.wav|96|What will happen then ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_129.wav|65|These people were my friends.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_023.wav|100|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_094.wav|13|He insisted that his staff were too.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_436.wav|63|But he gave no details.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_158.wav|68|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_199.wav|36|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_388.wav|32|The group will also become an Internet service provider.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_063.wav|37|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_436.wav|56|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_014.wav|100|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_327.wav|103|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_242.wav|0|It is the loss of my name.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_244.wav|77|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_189.wav|31|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_220.wav|58|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_235.wav|42|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_183.wav|51|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_310.wav|106|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_108.wav|45|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_227.wav|38|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_078.wav|0|He can win every week.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_252.wav|67|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_254.wav|39|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_342.wav|51|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_194.wav|102|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_173.wav|5|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_054.wav|18|I will make that point tonight.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_242.wav|63|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_258.wav|104|They are in care for a reason.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_050.wav|91|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_166.wav|100|The region is open for business.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_210.wav|25|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_022.wav|27|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_295.wav|102|People will make up their own minds.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_012.wav|47|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_369.wav|60|I think he will.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_309.wav|10|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_157.wav|104|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_149.wav|65|Is it in the right place?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_320.wav|25|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_162.wav|96|Tell it like it was ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_192.wav|19|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_423.wav|100|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_027.wav|99|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_169.wav|10|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_087.wav|58|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_180.wav|7|The second aspect was the fear of failure.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_290.wav|42|Taxation should be simplified.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_108.wav|74|Fishing is a declining industry.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_475.wav|65|I'm delighted for Andy.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_327.wav|55|Not one person spoke badly.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_360.wav|10|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_297.wav|81|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_149.wav|80|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_298.wav|77|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_169.wav|53|We had to work very hard for our points.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_166.wav|11|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_374.wav|51|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_079.wav|107|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_253.wav|95|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_016.wav|7|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p284/p284_096.wav|16|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_121.wav|81|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_077.wav|67|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_126.wav|45|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_362.wav|84|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_384.wav|56|It runs until the beginning of June.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_092.wav|40|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_183.wav|79|Then everyone must consider their future.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_343.wav|94|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_306.wav|62|You can't do one without the other.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_414.wav|36|We will stand for the nation.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_087.wav|68|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_192.wav|66|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_235.wav|4|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_129.wav|30|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_125.wav|38|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_352.wav|96|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_055.wav|81|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_339.wav|18|It's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_152.wav|53|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_376.wav|93|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_176.wav|97|Thereafter he left Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_146.wav|37|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_018.wav|23|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_136.wav|53|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_279.wav|13|He should be worried about me.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_016.wav|35|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_262.wav|75|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_366.wav|51|But let's not get carried away.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_329.wav|51|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_183.wav|102|This one was my best chance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_213.wav|40|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_268.wav|61|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_115.wav|64|I thought he was terrific.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_197.wav|66|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_404.wav|66|Golf has lost a great character.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_052.wav|26|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_196.wav|38|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_137.wav|67|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_009.wav|86|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_164.wav|68|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_460.wav|95|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_027.wav|40|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_005.wav|56|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_179.wav|67|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_391.wav|13|The police are not the target.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_279.wav|41|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_182.wav|77|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_124.wav|89|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_052.wav|27|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_184.wav|83|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_134.wav|52|There is no future in rock music.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_049.wav|101|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_148.wav|40|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_375.wav|78|It is almost certain to be the last.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_265.wav|44|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_091.wav|64|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_214.wav|47|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_027.wav|4|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_228.wav|0|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_059.wav|47|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_041.wav|90|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_178.wav|13|Only one person can claim the credit.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_199.wav|14|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_345.wav|21|So you let me know.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_034.wav|104|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_180.wav|44|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_276.wav|6|Can you believe it?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_407.wav|20|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_026.wav|95|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_182.wav|51|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_037.wav|92|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_023.wav|107|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_265.wav|49|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_452.wav|89|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_077.wav|31|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_349.wav|14|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_030.wav|95|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_331.wav|64|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_072.wav|80|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_304.wav|91|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_217.wav|55|The Boys can speak about little else.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_111.wav|29|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_288.wav|54|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_124.wav|73|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_022.wav|54|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_214.wav|104|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_367.wav|23|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_212.wav|6|We got on very well.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_002.wav|11|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_178.wav|50|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_421.wav|100|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_240.wav|59|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_295.wav|52|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_356.wav|47|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_011.wav|34|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_405.wav|104|It's a tragedy for the area.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_075.wav|22|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_376.wav|50|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_307.wav|102|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_106.wav|53|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_297.wav|48|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_390.wav|105|There was no trouble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_351.wav|54|Our children are our future.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_434.wav|27|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_288.wav|48|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_242.wav|48|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_226.wav|42|The group will report back in the summer.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_256.wav|26|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_384.wav|107|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_329.wav|18|He is in charge on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_100.wav|107|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_223.wav|51|We don't say there was a massacre.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_397.wav|107|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_195.wav|49|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_168.wav|42|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_034.wav|11|What you sow, you have to reap.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_106.wav|4|He, too, will return.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_007.wav|99|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_088.wav|33|One year later, he finally decided to act.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_315.wav|37|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_256.wav|70|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_274.wav|0|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_175.wav|30|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_220.wav|34|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_105.wav|7|But they must believe in themselves.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_022.wav|59|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_342.wav|77|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_373.wav|26|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_004.wav|57|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_095.wav|66|It's a difficult one to play.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_361.wav|7|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_228.wav|56|We have not been approached.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_137.wav|48|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_022.wav|48|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_128.wav|5|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_173.wav|62|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_216.wav|83|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_307.wav|26|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_266.wav|16|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_117.wav|47|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_203.wav|6|I really had to concentrate.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_119.wav|14|This is a step backwards.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_248.wav|65|They were game, but not very good.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_359.wav|34|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_017.wav|24|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_189.wav|106|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_032.wav|105|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_174.wav|20|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_359.wav|12|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_194.wav|25|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_049.wav|11|His condition was serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_079.wav|0|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_208.wav|13|We've got better players here.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_250.wav|37|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_144.wav|60|That was worth it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_266.wav|31|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_388.wav|97|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_252.wav|69|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_348.wav|46|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_326.wav|26|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_345.wav|104|Where are you taking her?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_020.wav|89|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_148.wav|89|The role of the law lords would be retained.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_067.wav|40|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_378.wav|91|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_169.wav|7|He was right into football from an early age.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_165.wav|73|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_271.wav|9|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_077.wav|77|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_190.wav|79|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_329.wav|20|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_295.wav|86|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_493.wav|24|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_272.wav|39|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_008.wav|27|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_204.wav|66|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_029.wav|71|"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_421.wav|65|They could change them tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_441.wav|36|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_247.wav|46|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_269.wav|35|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_340.wav|4|This Government is cutting taxes.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_064.wav|17|We shall not do that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_098.wav|32|I did not concentrate on my performance.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_435.wav|89|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_029.wav|74|But it's not just about that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_307.wav|79|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_140.wav|56|Today is not a victory.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_409.wav|0|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_169.wav|51|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_323.wav|74|That was always the danger.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_074.wav|28|More patience and composure was required.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_368.wav|47|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_028.wav|104|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_127.wav|34|I would never say anything against her.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_293.wav|34|Maybe his time has gone.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_155.wav|103|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_028.wav|107|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_306.wav|103|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_123.wav|18|But there was everything!
DUMMY2/p300/p300_004.wav|102|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_159.wav|60|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_394.wav|35|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_163.wav|74|What then is wrong?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_340.wav|7|The results are sometimes contentious.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_012.wav|86|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_361.wav|8|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_265.wav|23|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_314.wav|63|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_246.wav|9|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_092.wav|77|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_393.wav|34|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_327.wav|73|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_126.wav|84|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_227.wav|2|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_011.wav|36|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_333.wav|85|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_253.wav|39|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_288.wav|64|It's too big a risk to take.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_113.wav|76|We played so well at times.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_168.wav|76|This one is a special case.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_371.wav|45|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_170.wav|48|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_353.wav|95|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_289.wav|13|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_249.wav|4|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_363.wav|13|Glasgow is far from overload.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_337.wav|22|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_109.wav|81|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_375.wav|10|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_020.wav|60|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_095.wav|93|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_316.wav|32|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_440.wav|39|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_330.wav|67|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_227.wav|74|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_417.wav|38|Some things in life you have to accept.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_257.wav|53|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_039.wav|70|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_073.wav|85|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_369.wav|91|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_089.wav|34|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_239.wav|60|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_057.wav|14|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_214.wav|8|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_271.wav|65|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_295.wav|57|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_303.wav|42|It was quite a new prescription.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_199.wav|30|All the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_146.wav|32|The whole industry is a shambles.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_058.wav|100|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_118.wav|17|It may be argued.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_199.wav|79|People are trying to run away.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_034.wav|46|That didn't happen for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_119.wav|51|They have got their position, we have got our position.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_377.wav|32|Those people must be accountable.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_238.wav|29|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_189.wav|83|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_167.wav|2|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_110.wav|105|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_032.wav|5|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_280.wav|77|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_362.wav|2|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_327.wav|46|It's fantastic to have finally won.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_323.wav|14|There was no hint of scandal.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_001.wav|55|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_075.wav|30|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_112.wav|44|Tell you the team he picked?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_113.wav|67|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_285.wav|36|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_355.wav|6|One might think that it is a power.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_264.wav|47|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_008.wav|14|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p259/p259_021.wav|7|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p336/p336_026.wav|98|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_132.wav|5|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_265.wav|64|It has to be funded.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_226.wav|85|However, it proved to be the turning point.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_036.wav|43|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_379.wav|19|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_095.wav|45|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_123.wav|75|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_217.wav|76|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_289.wav|67|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_269.wav|21|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_310.wav|25|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_393.wav|100|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_147.wav|67|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_373.wav|20|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_158.wav|46|That's been our position all along.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_162.wav|23|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_389.wav|69|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_318.wav|105|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_017.wav|82|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_280.wav|88|We have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_270.wav|8|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_234.wav|1|To a level which we consider appropriate.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_316.wav|12|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_120.wav|15|The fire was still coming down.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_379.wav|37|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_424.wav|60|As for Owen, class is permanent.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_244.wav|27|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_001.wav|105|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_213.wav|20|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_025.wav|56|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_119.wav|107|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_131.wav|93|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_359.wav|104|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_040.wav|80|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_340.wav|20|Maloney was asked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_153.wav|47|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_095.wav|2|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_248.wav|66|I will not be pressured.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_120.wav|72|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_031.wav|17|And the winners are.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_035.wav|9|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_264.wav|106|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_114.wav|96|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_236.wav|50|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_062.wav|52|The referee is there to decide these things.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_087.wav|31|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_234.wav|90|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_185.wav|79|We want to be part of it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_104.wav|5|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_254.wav|98|He has refused to do that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_370.wav|105|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_412.wav|49|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_296.wav|43|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_012.wav|3|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_255.wav|66|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_344.wav|29|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_073.wav|4|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_189.wav|97|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p277/p277_454.wav|89|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_399.wav|21|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_136.wav|82|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_183.wav|11|It was just one of those days.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_077.wav|39|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_287.wav|2|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_066.wav|67|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_141.wav|77|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_167.wav|70|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_284.wav|49|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_325.wav|34|Then there is the terrain.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_214.wav|67|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_126.wav|61|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_410.wav|18|We have got to deal with it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_216.wav|45|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_080.wav|74|There was no commission.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_300.wav|26|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_059.wav|43|She's a spy!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_314.wav|105|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_442.wav|100|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_300.wav|1|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_112.wav|55|There was no reason.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_328.wav|21|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_170.wav|80|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_147.wav|16|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_324.wav|28|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_256.wav|50|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_009.wav|48|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_222.wav|9|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_196.wav|57|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_171.wav|63|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_261.wav|85|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_173.wav|61|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_093.wav|28|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_329.wav|73|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_285.wav|98|The cause remained a mystery last night.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_197.wav|94|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_050.wav|17|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_415.wav|62|Golf has lost a great character.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_338.wav|12|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_110.wav|15|There have been so many.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_412.wav|89|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_239.wav|49|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_183.wav|88|He had a horror.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_299.wav|6|He will have it within two weeks.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_028.wav|65|We're only taking on a couple just now.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_226.wav|72|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_179.wav|65|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_344.wav|99|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_041.wav|18|I didn't expect to get one.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_347.wav|1|We have to learn lessons from these things.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_055.wav|92|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_395.wav|52|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_152.wav|64|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_264.wav|39|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_143.wav|85|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_172.wav|62|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_040.wav|63|It is serious - but not that serious.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_055.wav|6|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_031.wav|1|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_500.wav|75|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_154.wav|69|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_364.wav|98|He was not alone.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_316.wav|44|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_014.wav|45|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_035.wav|26|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_018.wav|45|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_229.wav|37|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_017.wav|28|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_268.wav|92|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_075.wav|88|It's not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_036.wav|23|There is a growing anger among the group.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_135.wav|82|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_366.wav|77|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_171.wav|27|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_211.wav|76|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_209.wav|23|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_083.wav|33|I just wanted to get off the course.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_231.wav|36|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_222.wav|49|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_385.wav|45|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_121.wav|39|Pupils will be the losers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_404.wav|103|The film is about the cost of genius.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_152.wav|14|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_380.wav|64|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_156.wav|62|It is almost certain to be the last.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_265.wav|79|When she returned, it was a wreck.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_017.wav|93|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_215.wav|21|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_251.wav|22|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_193.wav|6|Their appeal will be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_270.wav|11|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_207.wav|83|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_126.wav|68|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_194.wav|99|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_265.wav|85|Another issue will be policing.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_318.wav|83|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_457.wav|100|No one wants to go through these things.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_240.wav|17|We can't get over it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_072.wav|5|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_422.wav|98|We thought we were looking in good shape.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_235.wav|44|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_066.wav|81|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_100.wav|44|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_180.wav|35|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_046.wav|77|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_253.wav|63|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_005.wav|38|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_453.wav|37|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_244.wav|13|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_042.wav|69|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_057.wav|105|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_367.wav|20|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_102.wav|1|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_347.wav|47|It was good for us that they lost that day.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_113.wav|23|The cost of war is more than that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_305.wav|75|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_285.wav|25|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_076.wav|53|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_152.wav|98|Controllers major concern is safety.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_232.wav|16|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_379.wav|103|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_358.wav|37|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_374.wav|63|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_020.wav|35|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_047.wav|107|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_239.wav|102|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_375.wav|75|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_263.wav|63|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_203.wav|15|But we have learned that it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_367.wav|24|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_082.wav|72|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_161.wav|21|That never came to court as a charge.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_010.wav|40|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_119.wav|69|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_179.wav|91|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_273.wav|65|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_201.wav|33|I went away to recover fully.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_276.wav|66|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_229.wav|23|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_157.wav|70|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_146.wav|17|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_356.wav|20|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_181.wav|39|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_209.wav|54|Others were even less confident.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_270.wav|41|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_301.wav|11|The atmosphere is businesslike.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_185.wav|47|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_340.wav|13|The review has been conducted fairly.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_243.wav|75|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_282.wav|35|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_002.wav|64|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_059.wav|64|It will come up here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_158.wav|56|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_378.wav|87|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_130.wav|94|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_361.wav|55|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_335.wav|43|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_164.wav|106|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_085.wav|27|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_204.wav|72|We should not worry about other players.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_152.wav|58|It was then into overtime.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_272.wav|0|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_029.wav|60|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_250.wav|104|There are no excuses left for us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_338.wav|20|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_271.wav|96|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_107.wav|7|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_137.wav|42|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_300.wav|84|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_043.wav|0|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_302.wav|9|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_180.wav|28|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_374.wav|54|This must have been severe.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_297.wav|64|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_036.wav|87|We are opening an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_063.wav|10|I'm looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_252.wav|104|His director of football is leaving.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_298.wav|48|We may need to take some very radical measures.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_338.wav|72|It really was my favourite.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_032.wav|98|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_205.wav|45|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_307.wav|89|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_036.wav|14|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_357.wav|12|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_339.wav|13|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_272.wav|57|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_423.wav|38|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_071.wav|26|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_115.wav|48|The partners are looking for answers.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_409.wav|65|You took the law into your own hands.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_158.wav|63|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_188.wav|3|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_360.wav|38|This man is serious about his work.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_404.wav|58|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_196.wav|55|Scottish Life was there over one year.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_098.wav|26|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_177.wav|104|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_201.wav|27|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_395.wav|103|And that started me thinking.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_008.wav|28|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_484.wav|48|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_260.wav|37|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_188.wav|51|It was a disaster of a race.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_053.wav|24|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_078.wav|88|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_013.wav|60|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_260.wav|23|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_002.wav|99|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_294.wav|83|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_023.wav|31|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_342.wav|107|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_023.wav|64|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_357.wav|105|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_308.wav|89|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_064.wav|77|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_144.wav|104|It is a question of life and death.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_291.wav|98|It's a national sport.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_138.wav|71|"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_141.wav|89|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_276.wav|59|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_108.wav|79|The results are very positive.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_068.wav|26|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_392.wav|70|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_121.wav|79|It is just a statement of fact.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_183.wav|76|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_129.wav|51|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_308.wav|65|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_236.wav|42|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_245.wav|32|Others agreed with this view.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_217.wav|26|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_210.wav|62|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_271.wav|53|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_401.wav|55|I managed to do that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_331.wav|4|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_273.wav|56|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_258.wav|9|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_332.wav|14|They come to enjoy themselves.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_067.wav|86|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_283.wav|60|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_191.wav|84|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_061.wav|27|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_223.wav|88|It would also delay the Scottish results.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_199.wav|104|That's been the case for a while.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_347.wav|72|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_305.wav|98|We meet again in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_048.wav|105|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_170.wav|11|Little girls are his victims.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_277.wav|31|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_006.wav|106|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_148.wav|103|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_132.wav|82|The whole matter is done and dusted.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_305.wav|80|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_450.wav|14|It certainly appeared that way.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_345.wav|106|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_181.wav|64|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_188.wav|61|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_197.wav|41|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_366.wav|7|Industrial action has to hurt.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_276.wav|77|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_242.wav|62|It's a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_070.wav|57|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_320.wav|43|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_394.wav|22|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_374.wav|48|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_357.wav|72|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_384.wav|6|We are in shock.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_035.wav|14|That is the face of fear.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_414.wav|49|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_196.wav|46|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_192.wav|59|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_338.wav|93|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_388.wav|23|I am sure that this will happen again.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_176.wav|51|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_049.wav|34|So, what's it about?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_222.wav|103|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_073.wav|57|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_299.wav|65|He had served his time.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_354.wav|1|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_127.wav|72|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_055.wav|85|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_163.wav|84|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_030.wav|41|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_147.wav|50|The whole industry is a shambles.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_198.wav|38|I'm not changing my mind.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_417.wav|33|The plane was shaking.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_008.wav|86|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_316.wav|23|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_241.wav|19|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_294.wav|84|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_040.wav|86|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_045.wav|15|His style is suited to Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_127.wav|89|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_339.wav|68|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_167.wav|32|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_170.wav|100|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_306.wav|83|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_144.wav|52|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_382.wav|40|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_205.wav|74|That's my daughter acting.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_241.wav|99|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_232.wav|66|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_269.wav|59|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_007.wav|64|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_380.wav|2|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_461.wav|63|They are defined by law.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_378.wav|100|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_328.wav|47|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_250.wav|95|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_222.wav|52|We are still seeking that complete performance.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_124.wav|75|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_205.wav|0|It has been like that all year for me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_092.wav|99|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_289.wav|89|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_025.wav|30|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_090.wav|63|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_301.wav|38|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_241.wav|13|It is up to us to approve it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_158.wav|45|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_056.wav|24|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_116.wav|21|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_290.wav|77|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_382.wav|13|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_179.wav|63|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_132.wav|62|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_066.wav|53|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_036.wav|102|He said he now intends to fly today.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_182.wav|62|That's when the story first appeared.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_290.wav|43|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_297.wav|101|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_049.wav|41|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_232.wav|70|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_158.wav|41|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_198.wav|39|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_380.wav|16|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_402.wav|4|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_084.wav|43|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_351.wav|81|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_110.wav|90|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_289.wav|28|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_107.wav|106|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_157.wav|36|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_205.wav|44|I'm going with all three.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_151.wav|34|We can do both.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_289.wav|14|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_338.wav|58|We will work through the night.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_034.wav|74|Do you think they would do any better?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_288.wav|69|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_139.wav|44|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_097.wav|64|They didn't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_253.wav|47|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_317.wav|62|Our system is archaic.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_072.wav|53|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_008.wav|43|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_130.wav|73|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_316.wav|33|But these things are happening now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_020.wav|52|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_400.wav|50|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_237.wav|97|My life is a mess.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_055.wav|91|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_307.wav|65|It's not a marketing scheme.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_227.wav|44|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_090.wav|60|We will continue to provide support for them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_349.wav|53|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_423.wav|6|He said he had no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_107.wav|59|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_326.wav|53|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_374.wav|26|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_149.wav|81|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_218.wav|45|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_197.wav|4|He confirmed there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_262.wav|20|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_147.wav|97|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_108.wav|29|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_420.wav|1|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_157.wav|101|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_056.wav|1|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_410.wav|98|She made no further comment.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_270.wav|97|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_302.wav|11|They use them for everything.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_147.wav|37|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_022.wav|22|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_031.wav|48|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_365.wav|7|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_131.wav|24|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_225.wav|3|Her experience is certainly limited.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_281.wav|105|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_358.wav|4|I am greatly encouraged.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_291.wav|17|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_018.wav|35|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_012.wav|23|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_127.wav|51|I really hope he thinks that through.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_090.wav|4|It is a very special place.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_317.wav|9|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_138.wav|95|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_155.wav|0|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_121.wav|1|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_080.wav|54|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_344.wav|37|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_207.wav|79|These are serious matters.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_013.wav|47|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_020.wav|34|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_364.wav|48|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_043.wav|85|We accept the challenge.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_268.wav|27|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_058.wav|97|I am a drug addict.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_050.wav|48|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_124.wav|100|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_224.wav|3|The force is with them.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_235.wav|95|This will take several weeks.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_104.wav|89|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_027.wav|62|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_190.wav|84|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_350.wav|17|Or do they?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_202.wav|59|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_251.wav|0|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_301.wav|33|It was an ongoing exercise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_034.wav|42|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_293.wav|40|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_207.wav|103|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_248.wav|39|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_058.wav|71|"This is a step backwards."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_067.wav|84|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_239.wav|21|We are expecting a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_079.wav|6|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_104.wav|1|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_195.wav|95|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_297.wav|93|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_195.wav|99|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_389.wav|7|They should take their mobile phones.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_186.wav|58|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_214.wav|91|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_205.wav|6|Frankly, they have to crack down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_368.wav|16|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_285.wav|9|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_468.wav|24|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_077.wav|78|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_301.wav|85|She had denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_044.wav|43|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_400.wav|0|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_208.wav|20|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_210.wav|93|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_063.wav|102|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_083.wav|24|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_047.wav|42|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_089.wav|88|But was it really so big?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_267.wav|0|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_341.wav|32|Writing has diminished in value.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_200.wav|34|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_377.wav|54|Farmers have been an endangered species.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_350.wav|6|Surely the answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_449.wav|37|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_314.wav|3|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_125.wav|49|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_043.wav|59|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_354.wav|75|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_174.wav|40|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_310.wav|18|We have nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_091.wav|67|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_412.wav|63|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_019.wav|46|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_339.wav|34|Angola was a really hard place.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_318.wav|8|He has left the company.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_141.wav|76|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_154.wav|9|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_215.wav|85|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_364.wav|69|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_179.wav|4|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_334.wav|85|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_266.wav|33|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_263.wav|19|It is up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_386.wav|95|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_341.wav|107|She's a valuable member of the Government.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_379.wav|94|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_232.wav|71|"Hospitals are for the ill."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_082.wav|50|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_034.wav|106|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_288.wav|104|A great deal was achieved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_063.wav|64|I didn't expect to get one.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_229.wav|63|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_365.wav|92|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_274.wav|107|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_338.wav|55|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_124.wav|40|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_306.wav|16|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_223.wav|6|The group will report back in the summer.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_305.wav|101|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_313.wav|32|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_089.wav|40|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_390.wav|48|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_179.wav|94|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_163.wav|76|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_292.wav|9|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_358.wav|98|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_390.wav|7|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_157.wav|103|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_189.wav|23|It's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_359.wav|54|They feel it belongs to them.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_029.wav|81|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_076.wav|12|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_330.wav|72|The matter will come up again.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_206.wav|107|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_128.wav|89|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_032.wav|84|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_291.wav|28|That's my big challenge.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_339.wav|94|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_044.wav|12|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_308.wav|56|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_021.wav|57|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_011.wav|43|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_225.wav|32|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_019.wav|79|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_183.wav|21|But experience is a wonderful thing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_135.wav|40|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_054.wav|76|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_160.wav|98|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_217.wav|53|I do not see this so much as failure.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_277.wav|89|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_074.wav|2|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_091.wav|2|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_332.wav|4|The German had a point to make.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_173.wav|59|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_470.wav|100|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_461.wav|8|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_326.wav|54|He made so many bad decisions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_409.wav|75|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_001.wav|50|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_204.wav|106|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_316.wav|59|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_248.wav|17|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_272.wav|100|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_116.wav|74|I have done ever since it was published.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_096.wav|33|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_083.wav|25|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_309.wav|77|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_334.wav|78|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_306.wav|18|But it did not last.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_222.wav|90|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_044.wav|98|This isn't a new problem.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_020.wav|50|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_108.wav|102|You either have him or you don't.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_182.wav|60|I try to be clear in the narrative.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_124.wav|26|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_371.wav|47|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_157.wav|45|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_320.wav|82|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_010.wav|46|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_016.wav|58|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_239.wav|11|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_359.wav|37|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_026.wav|47|It is a disaster area.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_248.wav|81|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_366.wav|105|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_310.wav|99|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_377.wav|38|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_005.wav|17|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_244.wav|73|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_287.wav|106|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_335.wav|4|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_147.wav|29|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_403.wav|78|He is a quality player.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_282.wav|56|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_456.wav|106|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_059.wav|104|We are only human.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_318.wav|32|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_038.wav|83|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_216.wav|71|"We could be here for a number of weeks."
DUMMY2/p258/p258_235.wav|26|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_245.wav|95|It was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_005.wav|77|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_221.wav|73|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_386.wav|20|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_121.wav|93|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_258.wav|45|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_302.wav|81|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_220.wav|59|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_054.wav|10|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_345.wav|31|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_280.wav|49|Scots actors should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_403.wav|16|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_149.wav|7|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_379.wav|78|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_051.wav|59|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_038.wav|25|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_034.wav|30|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_276.wav|62|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_162.wav|74|He, too, will return.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_206.wav|75|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_181.wav|53|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_188.wav|88|We are at war.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_100.wav|49|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_022.wav|29|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_041.wav|75|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_234.wav|34|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_302.wav|90|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_395.wav|102|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_032.wav|54|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_190.wav|107|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_138.wav|94|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_063.wav|106|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_379.wav|79|It's about New Yorkers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_089.wav|97|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_346.wav|1|She is very upset.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_344.wav|86|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_139.wav|98|He is that good.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_260.wav|98|All of them were killed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_160.wav|2|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_197.wav|67|What has caused the demise of singing ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_412.wav|96|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_062.wav|59|He should have asked for a second opinion.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_161.wav|28|She wanted to move.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_178.wav|71|"It's an idea."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_301.wav|21|It was a matter of chance.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_215.wav|18|The lottery has helped.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_283.wav|26|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_288.wav|74|We could have had no new money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_146.wav|73|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_385.wav|100|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_286.wav|60|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_210.wav|75|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_287.wav|89|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_061.wav|105|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_328.wav|70|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_006.wav|22|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_081.wav|105|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_200.wav|75|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_226.wav|26|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_186.wav|32|They responded well after the run of defeats.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_332.wav|45|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_232.wav|47|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_307.wav|85|Let's get to know him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_410.wav|17|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_420.wav|97|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_443.wav|89|Who would be in that desert?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_363.wav|74|Governments will have to respond.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_242.wav|104|That is however, the only part of the story.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_321.wav|100|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_447.wav|63|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_037.wav|95|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_032.wav|46|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_089.wav|29|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_406.wav|55|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_033.wav|103|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_057.wav|3|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_312.wav|60|You just have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_281.wav|55|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_122.wav|78|He was not alone at the top of the board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_209.wav|24|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_070.wav|78|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_216.wav|70|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_312.wav|27|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_221.wav|91|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_034.wav|53|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_175.wav|9|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_089.wav|48|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_191.wav|69|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_103.wav|46|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_112.wav|66|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_348.wav|26|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_104.wav|95|That is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_051.wav|49|They couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_323.wav|21|It is so out of character.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_202.wav|75|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_165.wav|86|There was no respite.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_088.wav|8|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p314/p314_005.wav|51|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_377.wav|31|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_398.wav|35|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_075.wav|90|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_410.wav|89|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_345.wav|40|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_156.wav|42|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_170.wav|22|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_393.wav|72|Hard it will be.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_459.wav|106|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_036.wav|76|The waiting is over, well almost.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_161.wav|81|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_332.wav|6|We need to regroup.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_181.wav|100|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_140.wav|76|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_285.wav|79|And he did that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_290.wav|89|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_094.wav|64|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_212.wav|30|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_088.wav|95|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_359.wav|87|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_275.wav|46|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_288.wav|84|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_189.wav|15|The First Minister is an addict.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_049.wav|73|TODAY it begins.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_018.wav|39|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_273.wav|53|I think I was about four years old.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_149.wav|42|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_190.wav|12|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_101.wav|14|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_248.wav|11|It all depends on the Chancellor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_088.wav|23|I could not believe what they were saying.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_054.wav|67|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_284.wav|98|I am not a liar.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_118.wav|47|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_041.wav|94|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_209.wav|48|He is a very talented player.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_438.wav|95|Being with me is an honour.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_391.wav|4|I had to calm down.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_318.wav|25|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_363.wav|103|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_201.wav|97|Who is the employer?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_399.wav|7|The salary changes are long overdue.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_019.wav|52|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_441.wav|100|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_089.wav|9|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_228.wav|67|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_370.wav|1|I have chosen to do this research.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_212.wav|11|We're very close to being a good team.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_228.wav|4|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_320.wav|107|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_331.wav|22|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_066.wav|100|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_203.wav|93|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_137.wav|38|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_111.wav|58|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_110.wav|103|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_353.wav|16|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_054.wav|66|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_207.wav|25|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_304.wav|23|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_330.wav|104|He wants to play in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_353.wav|25|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_045.wav|7|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_395.wav|28|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_340.wav|54|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_049.wav|80|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_344.wav|36|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_297.wav|42|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_156.wav|17|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_119.wav|19|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_168.wav|64|They got the job done.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_190.wav|72|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_084.wav|51|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_332.wav|96|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_035.wav|69|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_171.wav|26|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_122.wav|54|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_023.wav|105|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_161.wav|54|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_316.wav|30|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_115.wav|38|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_251.wav|84|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_099.wav|9|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_116.wav|66|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_051.wav|52|I'm as fit as I can get.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_017.wav|47|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_035.wav|28|How would it work?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_041.wav|81|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_163.wav|63|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_088.wav|19|This could be her way forward.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_150.wav|16|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_026.wav|60|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_175.wav|88|I'm delighted for the lads.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_064.wav|96|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_363.wav|58|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_148.wav|21|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_144.wav|50|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_050.wav|100|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_344.wav|68|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_337.wav|61|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_209.wav|60|Everyone is too upset to comment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_210.wav|32|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_272.wav|7|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_200.wav|28|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_213.wav|66|He was a soldier.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_289.wav|80|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_084.wav|105|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_399.wav|95|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_326.wav|105|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_375.wav|39|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_392.wav|65|We have done our own tests.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_130.wav|62|It is a very big problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_020.wav|48|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_144.wav|29|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_476.wav|7|He deserved a red card.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_416.wav|46|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_405.wav|85|I am glad that justice has been done.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_114.wav|69|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_024.wav|71|"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_388.wav|62|Nobody ever gets to see them.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_405.wav|35|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_247.wav|37|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_056.wav|39|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_360.wav|35|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_162.wav|20|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_336.wav|40|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_248.wav|107|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_176.wav|57|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_329.wav|83|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_184.wav|91|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_352.wav|2|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_237.wav|27|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_028.wav|9|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_024.wav|15|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_340.wav|84|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_016.wav|24|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_078.wav|33|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_009.wav|9|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_372.wav|50|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_294.wav|85|War and force are not the only solutions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_144.wav|7|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_195.wav|5|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_400.wav|7|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_009.wav|63|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_006.wav|26|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_023.wav|48|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_166.wav|0|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_023.wav|88|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_198.wav|53|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_343.wav|62|This is perfectly legal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_144.wav|34|New blood is essential for progress.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_417.wav|106|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_150.wav|54|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_362.wav|107|So just what is her enduring appeal?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_130.wav|12|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_218.wav|25|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_048.wav|0|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_254.wav|52|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_302.wav|101|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_154.wav|98|Because he usually is.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_077.wav|70|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_336.wav|9|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_220.wav|45|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_390.wav|103|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_436.wav|95|It is based on a true story.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_083.wav|104|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_282.wav|51|We will build upon the basic state pension.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_110.wav|34|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_085.wav|11|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_381.wav|50|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_267.wav|54|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_010.wav|34|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_378.wav|46|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_120.wav|85|It's great news, isn't it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_340.wav|58|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_401.wav|16|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_345.wav|48|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_312.wav|22|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_305.wav|87|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_430.wav|63|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_242.wav|44|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_261.wav|93|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_056.wav|77|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_277.wav|103|He doesn't do dinner.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_350.wav|84|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_153.wav|81|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_365.wav|32|It was a unanimous decision.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_118.wav|82|We just want a fair deal.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_293.wav|25|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_123.wav|102|This is not understood by people outside.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_463.wav|32|It's because they can't understand the language.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_070.wav|91|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_195.wav|26|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_137.wav|47|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_012.wav|89|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_246.wav|80|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_157.wav|6|It appears to have been successful.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_280.wav|93|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_406.wav|24|Rugby is a hard game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_219.wav|70|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_092.wav|10|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_389.wav|8|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_116.wav|65|Nothing would now surprise me.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_383.wav|7|I think we'll just keep it.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_185.wav|106|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_015.wav|24|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_119.wav|72|It's totally double standards.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_321.wav|82|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_172.wav|72|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_158.wav|40|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_221.wav|47|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_392.wav|27|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_397.wav|76|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_378.wav|27|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_362.wav|9|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_255.wav|7|We will try to find someone.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_041.wav|3|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_003.wav|66|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_237.wav|102|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_151.wav|16|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_032.wav|73|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_144.wav|83|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_037.wav|83|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_119.wav|1|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_218.wav|42|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_127.wav|23|The Taliban response was swift.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_152.wav|40|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_082.wav|83|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_280.wav|41|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_052.wav|98|He died from multiple injuries.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_207.wav|34|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_249.wav|13|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_292.wav|92|Anyone can still win this tournament.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_098.wav|57|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_003.wav|105|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_312.wav|107|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_093.wav|48|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_131.wav|69|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_107.wav|26|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_366.wav|1|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_292.wav|91|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_163.wav|13|The president will not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_148.wav|19|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_214.wav|27|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_204.wav|2|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_036.wav|99|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_312.wav|54|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_104.wav|3|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_374.wav|85|We said it will happen one night.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_220.wav|90|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_045.wav|39|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_050.wav|56|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_307.wav|33|It was all very proper and civilised.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_113.wav|53|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_109.wav|34|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_080.wav|56|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_028.wav|75|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_278.wav|43|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_309.wav|6|Norton was delighted with his successes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_338.wav|45|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_332.wav|5|This is the last straw.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_199.wav|74|What does that mean?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_130.wav|88|The timing is wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_315.wav|47|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_405.wav|42|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_089.wav|62|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_151.wav|89|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_279.wav|33|My only concern is for my children.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_198.wav|26|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_094.wav|56|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_303.wav|8|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_223.wav|22|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_002.wav|51|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_172.wav|104|Art is still a risky investment.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_283.wav|12|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_132.wav|64|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_327.wav|24|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_165.wav|47|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_231.wav|104|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_337.wav|89|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_387.wav|18|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_117.wav|55|That is the only way to rate players.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_348.wav|49|It was certainly intense.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_214.wav|4|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_029.wav|99|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_261.wav|36|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_269.wav|41|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_149.wav|1|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_268.wav|69|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_036.wav|94|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_201.wav|70|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_155.wav|38|And therein lies the whole problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_130.wav|19|We need to make more inquiries about that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_320.wav|76|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_139.wav|68|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_053.wav|63|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_392.wav|56|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_056.wav|10|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_408.wav|85|That is my preference.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_414.wav|97|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_307.wav|29|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_469.wav|65|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_090.wav|90|It was nice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_308.wav|5|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_331.wav|11|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_018.wav|24|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_388.wav|19|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_265.wav|50|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_002.wav|34|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_029.wav|32|Not if you know the person.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_022.wav|45|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_144.wav|69|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_260.wav|99|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_343.wav|85|I was shocked and outraged.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_273.wav|20|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_198.wav|82|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_015.wav|103|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_216.wav|6|You are going to have to do it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_140.wav|43|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_111.wav|45|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_168.wav|43|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_059.wav|90|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_060.wav|24|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_075.wav|81|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_329.wav|5|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_366.wav|75|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_310.wav|104|He added, We are full of anger.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_361.wav|46|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_362.wav|26|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_364.wav|6|Experience in this work is paramount.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_208.wav|18|It is not as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_400.wav|4|In short, the club was broke.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_036.wav|60|I want to deliver a learning society.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_139.wav|78|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_377.wav|26|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_316.wav|55|Motherwell took them from half chances.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_103.wav|8|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_060.wav|32|He hadn't had them for a long time.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_273.wav|61|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_087.wav|6|He later told The Herald, It is true.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_004.wav|44|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_406.wav|46|I believe in God.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_140.wav|20|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_151.wav|64|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_173.wav|98|Everything is accounted for.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_152.wav|49|The elections should have no role in this.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_238.wav|89|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_276.wav|89|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_266.wav|18|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_108.wav|51|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_222.wav|12|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_368.wav|1|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_035.wav|15|His mother was English.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_073.wav|11|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_316.wav|37|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_018.wav|68|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_175.wav|7|US is the only country to vote against resolution.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_289.wav|70|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_157.wav|28|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_115.wav|94|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_063.wav|97|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_250.wav|61|It's quite a line-up !
DUMMY2/p341/p341_090.wav|66|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_200.wav|76|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_098.wav|43|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_215.wav|10|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_216.wav|13|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_321.wav|29|I have got a victim.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_400.wav|41|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_322.wav|67|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_424.wav|13|It's time for a change.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_284.wav|59|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_340.wav|41|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_272.wav|45|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_174.wav|69|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_448.wav|100|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_406.wav|42|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_148.wav|48|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_362.wav|31|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_243.wav|94|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_215.wav|84|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_317.wav|73|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_315.wav|67|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_377.wav|63|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_281.wav|84|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_347.wav|35|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_054.wav|57|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_003.wav|24|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_262.wav|9|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_303.wav|40|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_033.wav|96|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_374.wav|15|We all want the same things.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_172.wav|57|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_244.wav|35|Here is a question for you.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_260.wav|8|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_088.wav|5|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_111.wav|64|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_194.wav|79|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_057.wav|28|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_428.wav|63|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_149.wav|39|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_277.wav|35|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_138.wav|47|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_047.wav|90|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_122.wav|8|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_183.wav|63|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_394.wav|103|As if he were a High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_279.wav|18|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_334.wav|86|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_239.wav|37|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_131.wav|43|I was furious.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_319.wav|20|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_028.wav|62|He is doing the right things.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_339.wav|93|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_184.wav|40|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_176.wav|55|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_161.wav|78|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_095.wav|39|It might change your life.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_132.wav|61|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_226.wav|39|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_304.wav|70|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_313.wav|19|Some of their movement was excellent.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_369.wav|74|Frankly it was disgusting.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_237.wav|101|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_251.wav|58|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_253.wav|51|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_140.wav|27|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_159.wav|27|Words were not required.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_294.wav|56|was everything done to save the people ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_083.wav|53|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_149.wav|75|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_014.wav|40|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_308.wav|14|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_300.wav|76|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_225.wav|52|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_020.wav|62|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_250.wav|85|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_031.wav|86|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_323.wav|38|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_452.wav|100|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_138.wav|98|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_172.wav|81|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_351.wav|20|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_303.wav|51|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_222.wav|45|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_023.wav|81|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_266.wav|52|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_404.wav|33|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_005.wav|92|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_271.wav|55|This was the perfect setting.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_037.wav|56|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_076.wav|89|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_376.wav|97|I think it was briefly considered.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_338.wav|81|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_257.wav|39|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_082.wav|76|This does not help.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_092.wav|6|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_372.wav|60|Frankly, that's not good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_023.wav|73|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_238.wav|82|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_246.wav|79|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_377.wav|25|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_326.wav|82|I was waiting for that question.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_008.wav|74|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_022.wav|21|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_003.wav|8|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_296.wav|105|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_039.wav|40|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_236.wav|25|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_139.wav|30|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_286.wav|31|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_349.wav|29|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_380.wav|49|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_067.wav|92|And he listens to his artists as well.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_116.wav|7|The result is a vacuum.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_117.wav|36|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_171.wav|2|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_209.wav|96|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_047.wav|44|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_282.wav|102|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_225.wav|47|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_115.wav|50|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_251.wav|55|Perhaps it will happen again.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_068.wav|41|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_311.wav|8|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_099.wav|99|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_391.wav|17|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_136.wav|50|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_181.wav|92|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_411.wav|75|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_297.wav|70|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_293.wav|14|I understand the security issue.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_042.wav|100|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_004.wav|64|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_019.wav|88|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_261.wav|53|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_277.wav|68|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_393.wav|38|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_195.wav|37|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_309.wav|65|Five years ago its return was rejected.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_003.wav|104|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_163.wav|105|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_256.wav|13|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_298.wav|105|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_096.wav|29|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_365.wav|16|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_330.wav|85|But we will not be scared.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_151.wav|86|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_196.wav|6|A decision is expected tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_060.wav|9|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_240.wav|67|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_068.wav|73|The results are tragic.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_039.wav|32|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_225.wav|55|Now the door has opened.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_312.wav|90|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_391.wav|105|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_289.wav|58|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_327.wav|23|Life is too short.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_003.wav|87|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_107.wav|105|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_284.wav|34|Is it a threat to union?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_051.wav|64|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_308.wav|17|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_417.wav|49|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_296.wav|54|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_184.wav|9|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_141.wav|66|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_191.wav|32|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_414.wav|92|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_200.wav|92|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_269.wav|10|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_097.wav|96|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_138.wav|82|I was on my own.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_102.wav|78|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_240.wav|65|This is a big game for both of us.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_089.wav|67|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_266.wav|58|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_300.wav|105|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_410.wav|70|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_376.wav|79|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_041.wav|52|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_036.wav|106|A fiver and I'll tell.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_289.wav|17|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_403.wav|77|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_106.wav|60|Consumers will also benefit.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_034.wav|5|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_115.wav|39|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_271.wav|22|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_057.wav|40|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_140.wav|73|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_294.wav|93|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_143.wav|37|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_021.wav|103|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_119.wav|24|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_332.wav|106|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_228.wav|105|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_348.wav|29|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_080.wav|22|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_025.wav|46|A crucial moment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_249.wav|33|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_227.wav|55|Her death is a huge blow.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_070.wav|45|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_035.wav|103|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_012.wav|39|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_292.wav|61|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_268.wav|8|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_116.wav|32|Which can happen any time.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_085.wav|69|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_360.wav|67|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_273.wav|83|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_257.wav|94|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_364.wav|89|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_038.wav|29|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_294.wav|41|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_462.wav|48|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_175.wav|97|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_155.wav|35|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_292.wav|59|He has retired.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_091.wav|35|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_141.wav|93|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_337.wav|17|I have found my vision.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_090.wav|13|We should be capable of managing it, though.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_331.wav|8|It will set the tone.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_113.wav|65|Firm action must be taken.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_186.wav|78|The feeling is hard to describe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_225.wav|35|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_430.wav|7|The next few months will tell.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_053.wav|67|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_030.wav|67|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_013.wav|33|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_221.wav|71|"My wife and family are the support system."
DUMMY2/p241/p241_209.wav|86|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_027.wav|6|It was actually very, very difficult.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_365.wav|13|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_096.wav|107|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_391.wav|89|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_127.wav|26|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_224.wav|76|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_141.wav|105|I feel very grateful with everything.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_292.wav|100|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_207.wav|17|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_136.wav|17|He is dying from cancer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_079.wav|75|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_223.wav|3|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_327.wav|84|It added to the spectacle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_474.wav|50|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_118.wav|59|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_264.wav|36|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_248.wav|0|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_075.wav|45|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_221.wav|11|Not so, he insisted.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_321.wav|6|It was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_371.wav|76|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_271.wav|43|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_135.wav|100|The others have all been in storage for some time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_235.wav|10|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_417.wav|11|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_017.wav|52|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_170.wav|3|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_276.wav|93|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_367.wav|103|So what does one do?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_187.wav|63|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_330.wav|61|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_229.wav|15|We have nowhere to go.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_431.wav|14|No date has been fixed for his return.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_076.wav|11|What method of funding is being used?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_065.wav|15|She had no chance.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_145.wav|65|The truth will come out.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_252.wav|74|They set up to win the hole.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_285.wav|102|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_294.wav|77|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_033.wav|17|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_130.wav|40|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_314.wav|42|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_021.wav|86|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_093.wav|61|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_102.wav|45|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_024.wav|14|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_170.wav|46|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_407.wav|27|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_392.wav|8|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_363.wav|11|But when we do it is great.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_168.wav|17|And then came the seventies.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_102.wav|51|The proposal was rejected.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_230.wav|47|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_223.wav|55|Brian was last to join.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_126.wav|62|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_071.wav|94|It's a winner.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_353.wav|19|He was made redundant in February last year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_189.wav|38|This is not a struggle against Islam.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_363.wav|67|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_115.wav|74|I have never been in anything like that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_056.wav|62|My only concern is for my children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_030.wav|79|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_061.wav|95|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_373.wav|54|The company has other problems with the shells.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_308.wav|73|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_400.wav|75|It certainly appeared that way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_069.wav|60|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_404.wav|11|Well, you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_330.wav|9|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_170.wav|72|They would have looked out for each other.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_194.wav|3|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_314.wav|51|We are waiting for them to calm down.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_165.wav|105|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_405.wav|77|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_078.wav|97|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_333.wav|17|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_145.wav|36|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_020.wav|57|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_029.wav|28|We have got to attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_077.wav|75|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_048.wav|39|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_383.wav|38|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_079.wav|98|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_388.wav|95|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_280.wav|29|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_150.wav|69|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_352.wav|37|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_028.wav|16|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_079.wav|14|Both men were on one-year contracts.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_288.wav|56|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_209.wav|20|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_404.wav|77|No, because it was too many.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_215.wav|19|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_369.wav|18|The night is young.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_349.wav|83|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_128.wav|100|I have accepted the challenge.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_033.wav|71|"Because we do not need it."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_133.wav|89|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_338.wav|10|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_360.wav|14|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_133.wav|99|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_170.wav|66|We must not give in to bastards.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_461.wav|65|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_303.wav|18|That is not good for golf!
DUMMY2/p274/p274_259.wav|32|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_242.wav|12|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_290.wav|28|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_259.wav|9|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_011.wav|69|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_340.wav|46|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_206.wav|82|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_304.wav|60|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_418.wav|95|That's all I can say.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_125.wav|11|It's up to them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_236.wav|76|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_168.wav|104|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_025.wav|63|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_454.wav|14|Police have appealed for witnesses.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_025.wav|7|But it could prove disastrous.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_355.wav|104|The support of Britain is assumed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_128.wav|51|Police were also perplexed.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_033.wav|9|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_220.wav|21|I didn't actually work up a speech.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_157.wav|93|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_388.wav|66|Such people do not exist.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_231.wav|81|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_325.wav|31|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_378.wav|26|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_365.wav|87|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_414.wav|106|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_262.wav|72|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_228.wav|91|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_222.wav|87|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_081.wav|44|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_003.wav|22|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_123.wav|2|It is not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_365.wav|83|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_222.wav|65|The two companies were not for sale.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_210.wav|58|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_256.wav|94|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_341.wav|45|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_026.wav|8|They will not be allowed to succeed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_402.wav|2|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_014.wav|75|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_108.wav|64|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_006.wav|105|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_264.wav|68|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_161.wav|80|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_160.wav|93|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_069.wav|53|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_301.wav|2|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_361.wav|4|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_171.wav|105|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_238.wav|60|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_047.wav|78|The whole thing is the music.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_102.wav|14|But it is up again.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_218.wav|81|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_106.wav|6|He had never run the distance before.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_071.wav|34|The law has got to be upheld.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_142.wav|14|I learned that only yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_311.wav|92|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_139.wav|103|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_029.wav|52|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_037.wav|79|This decision is folly.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_297.wav|85|Which brings us to the point.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_218.wav|106|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_173.wav|11|The rest is his own.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_071.wav|1|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_378.wav|28|But sometimes it works out all right.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_372.wav|97|It broke up my marriage.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_004.wav|74|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_038.wav|100|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_374.wav|6|There is nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_238.wav|38|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_045.wav|27|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_130.wav|35|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_305.wav|40|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_355.wav|8|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_312.wav|80|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_325.wav|72|I hope he has learned from it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_109.wav|63|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_035.wav|51|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_338.wav|60|But this is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_416.wav|11|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_036.wav|68|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_420.wav|4|We will listen to colleagues.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_400.wav|33|You find it bizarre?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_021.wav|49|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_225.wav|16|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_164.wav|12|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_412.wav|33|Everything else is second.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_083.wav|10|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_261.wav|63|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_048.wav|99|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_041.wav|39|It could well be the case.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_068.wav|27|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_297.wav|55|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_315.wav|24|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_186.wav|73|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_255.wav|87|Their extinction is not inevitable.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_221.wav|74|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_313.wav|73|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_209.wav|74|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_195.wav|93|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_237.wav|8|That was a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_188.wav|23|But Allen is deadly serious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_214.wav|60|It was one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_229.wav|77|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_030.wav|9|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_220.wav|77|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_242.wav|68|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_084.wav|22|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_229.wav|88|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_123.wav|106|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_096.wav|97|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_325.wav|5|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_230.wav|93|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_283.wav|85|There are no quick fixes.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_385.wav|97|But he has strong links to Labour.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_172.wav|106|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_024.wav|49|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_202.wav|35|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_286.wav|36|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_481.wav|75|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_271.wav|99|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_138.wav|86|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_379.wav|58|And that's the question for the Chamber.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_310.wav|66|What are you going to do exactly?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_088.wav|47|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_043.wav|70|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_001.wav|29|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_106.wav|40|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_059.wav|57|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_080.wav|25|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_313.wav|1|They also intend to travel today.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_099.wav|3|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_032.wav|95|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_077.wav|66|The settlement could run to millions.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_258.wav|37|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_207.wav|29|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_014.wav|43|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_453.wav|27|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_037.wav|42|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_371.wav|54|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_075.wav|37|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_196.wav|83|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_396.wav|16|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_429.wav|27|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_005.wav|67|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_103.wav|13|I have got a knife.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_378.wav|19|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_357.wav|76|It seems very odd.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_111.wav|43|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_008.wav|10|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_140.wav|85|And so the cycle continues.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_185.wav|19|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_423.wav|4|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_120.wav|31|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_034.wav|26|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_014.wav|54|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_189.wav|1|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_105.wav|16|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_135.wav|42|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_276.wav|104|Neither of them was badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_132.wav|83|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_301.wav|97|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_196.wav|34|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_091.wav|1|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_441.wav|48|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_099.wav|8|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_172.wav|28|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_201.wav|65|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_391.wav|97|This looks like it is anything but open.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_024.wav|61|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_097.wav|22|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_448.wav|75|No options are excluded at all.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_355.wav|46|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_378.wav|34|We have been extremely lucky this time.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_241.wav|76|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_180.wav|53|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_253.wav|12|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_240.wav|69|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_251.wav|13|I said, What was that about?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_121.wav|18|We're very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_085.wav|81|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_287.wav|31|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_230.wav|50|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_005.wav|61|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_085.wav|72|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_188.wav|7|He played it like a veteran.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_335.wav|13|The best option is to destroy the plants.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_276.wav|30|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_329.wav|47|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_309.wav|35|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_116.wav|105|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_277.wav|105|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_232.wav|39|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_280.wav|106|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_183.wav|85|Of course it is still possible.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_114.wav|49|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_309.wav|98|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_101.wav|25|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_157.wav|44|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_029.wav|105|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_380.wav|39|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_119.wav|93|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_385.wav|28|I have to keep working hard.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_051.wav|68|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_317.wav|99|He was unable to come.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_035.wav|20|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_181.wav|96|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_412.wav|17|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_389.wav|13|Such cases are on the increase.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_047.wav|91|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_254.wav|1|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_070.wav|58|They had had time for little else.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_103.wav|6|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_219.wav|75|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_447.wav|100|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_391.wav|35|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_305.wav|31|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_011.wav|22|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_131.wav|3|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_334.wav|17|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_258.wav|99|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_345.wav|93|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_365.wav|10|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_035.wav|100|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_277.wav|78|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_358.wav|14|The pain is still acute.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_142.wav|40|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_070.wav|84|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_276.wav|101|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_108.wav|10|We have got a race.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_411.wav|76|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_011.wav|50|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_157.wav|21|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_269.wav|36|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_324.wav|103|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_352.wav|95|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_081.wav|98|The issues are not going to change.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_115.wav|65|That's the bit that's wrong.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_177.wav|90|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_331.wav|38|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_001.wav|99|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_332.wav|32|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_021.wav|73|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_113.wav|20|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_184.wav|6|I feel really confident in that department.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_017.wav|49|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_034.wav|67|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_014.wav|82|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_324.wav|25|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_304.wav|31|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_094.wav|3|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_451.wav|106|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_305.wav|76|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_269.wav|24|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_331.wav|70|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_310.wav|57|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_165.wav|54|We have already begun to do that here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_266.wav|56|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_410.wav|10|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_059.wav|52|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_390.wav|35|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_141.wav|54|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_165.wav|100|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_284.wav|74|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_262.wav|48|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_099.wav|25|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_224.wav|5|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_173.wav|2|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_004.wav|9|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_235.wav|32|Paterson can afford to be generous.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_030.wav|26|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_269.wav|58|I hope my successor will do the same.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_400.wav|42|She now lives in London.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_336.wav|4|Bomber was not amused.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_306.wav|64|They certainly do not socialise.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_309.wav|103|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_342.wav|75|It was almost too much.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_387.wav|28|Art is still a risky investment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_370.wav|36|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_372.wav|55|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_125.wav|59|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_005.wav|104|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_043.wav|26|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_040.wav|45|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_287.wav|56|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_052.wav|62|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_133.wav|50|It is a common problem.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_355.wav|103|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_223.wav|107|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_068.wav|72|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_056.wav|3|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_210.wav|36|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_235.wav|19|My body is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_155.wav|89|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_301.wav|52|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_274.wav|99|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_108.wav|55|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_240.wav|72|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_034.wav|2|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_061.wav|64|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_306.wav|39|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_152.wav|9|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_111.wav|63|It's not a holiday time for football players.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_041.wav|16|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_012.wav|48|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_015.wav|43|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_222.wav|73|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_212.wav|22|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_010.wav|18|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_301.wav|40|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_290.wav|79|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_116.wav|20|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_200.wav|102|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_196.wav|41|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_296.wav|34|I have never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_094.wav|45|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_170.wav|31|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_240.wav|64|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_400.wav|69|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_118.wav|102|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_325.wav|40|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_233.wav|51|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_357.wav|5|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_152.wav|39|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_110.wav|79|Which is where we come in.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_294.wav|59|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_134.wav|37|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_065.wav|11|Where is the discipline?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_397.wav|91|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_388.wav|106|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_357.wav|94|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_138.wav|23|Somehow they got out.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_303.wav|28|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_122.wav|103|David was not either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_078.wav|4|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_122.wav|64|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_223.wav|42|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_267.wav|90|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_039.wav|47|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_263.wav|98|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_407.wav|104|I don't think there's going to be one.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_373.wav|76|Frank Warren is a great man.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_162.wav|78|There is a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_269.wav|96|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_199.wav|19|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_133.wav|81|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_065.wav|94|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_404.wav|16|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_296.wav|30|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_381.wav|60|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_056.wav|70|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_320.wav|33|He also seems to have been around forever.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_341.wav|92|The last few weeks have been really bad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_179.wav|90|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_326.wav|1|They were at her bedside when she died.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_036.wav|21|I go in for the parts.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_334.wav|29|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_278.wav|100|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_100.wav|53|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_289.wav|63|It wasn't about one player.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_343.wav|104|There are moments of joy in politics.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_184.wav|93|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_405.wav|4|It was the same old story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_249.wav|34|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_290.wav|102|This is still a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_043.wav|2|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_122.wav|31|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_032.wav|76|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_172.wav|7|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_091.wav|19|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_353.wav|40|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_399.wav|28|So is the rest of British sport.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_270.wav|13|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_171.wav|45|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_103.wav|25|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_393.wav|85|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_315.wav|36|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_215.wav|36|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_166.wav|66|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_135.wav|81|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_197.wav|32|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_268.wav|73|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_196.wav|21|These days are over.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_018.wav|105|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_188.wav|94|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_207.wav|0|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_240.wav|96|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_201.wav|78|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_373.wav|0|They are used to the big stage.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_355.wav|102|I didn't even have the first idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_297.wav|87|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_125.wav|91|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_058.wav|36|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_079.wav|91|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_262.wav|15|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_357.wav|33|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_176.wav|45|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_168.wav|7|This action reflects a slump in bookings.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_013.wav|88|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_022.wav|102|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_278.wav|33|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_212.wav|2|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_293.wav|4|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_280.wav|89|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_176.wav|92|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_099.wav|47|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_142.wav|8|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_221.wav|28|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_184.wav|1|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_266.wav|14|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_041.wav|14|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_297.wav|37|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_423.wav|16|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_303.wav|93|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_179.wav|44|One person was believed to have been hit.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_326.wav|58|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_178.wav|85|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_412.wav|72|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_074.wav|49|The team this year is going places.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_218.wav|14|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_394.wav|94|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_098.wav|58|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_078.wav|47|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_347.wav|95|But I think it's different from the rest!
DUMMY2/p345/p345_261.wav|82|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_172.wav|100|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_064.wav|5|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_269.wav|50|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_319.wav|72|The teenager had been missing for six months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_006.wav|3|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_066.wav|107|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_298.wav|63|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_377.wav|20|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_143.wav|81|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_069.wav|32|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_371.wav|48|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_031.wav|51|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_171.wav|10|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_253.wav|62|He leaves a beat.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_264.wav|76|We are playing them at their own game.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_053.wav|92|For sure we want to win it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_334.wav|25|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_297.wav|58|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_049.wav|103|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_242.wav|7|He must get to know himself.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_458.wav|100|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_074.wav|27|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_155.wav|49|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_002.wav|5|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_135.wav|32|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_286.wav|62|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_293.wav|79|Well, that's all right then.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_147.wav|102|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_162.wav|1|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_250.wav|68|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_081.wav|25|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_035.wav|68|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_230.wav|46|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_288.wav|5|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_330.wav|80|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_473.wav|39|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_252.wav|93|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_329.wav|19|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_077.wav|103|I am so sorry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_099.wav|27|It is home-grown.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_257.wav|70|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_199.wav|20|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_306.wav|38|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_209.wav|67|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_186.wav|21|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_042.wav|85|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_257.wav|23|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_156.wav|25|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_308.wav|75|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_370.wav|78|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_367.wav|106|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_134.wav|78|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_192.wav|36|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_346.wav|104|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_249.wav|79|And that was just the start.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_067.wav|5|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_137.wav|60|The only safe investment is cash.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_390.wav|21|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_308.wav|98|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_257.wav|4|Faces from the Eighties.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_049.wav|8|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_110.wav|82|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_353.wav|8|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_160.wav|47|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_399.wav|54|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_237.wav|13|I was a little surprised.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_156.wav|59|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_105.wav|25|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_203.wav|36|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_236.wav|4|He gets his moment.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_029.wav|26|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_193.wav|3|The performance is not there.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_027.wav|63|I am pretty careful with money.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_129.wav|46|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_138.wav|29|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_341.wav|3|We will deliver at director level.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_211.wav|33|But it was money well spent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_417.wav|60|This was great for our sport.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_377.wav|102|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_188.wav|5|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_097.wav|65|Does the name matter?)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_122.wav|57|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_062.wav|93|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_397.wav|92|That is European law.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_156.wav|71|"I was in daily contact."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_022.wav|32|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_427.wav|32|Such an attack is bizarre.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_095.wav|97|However, it is much bigger than that.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_216.wav|93|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_120.wav|64|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_396.wav|103|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_044.wav|2|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_062.wav|78|The company continues to grow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_112.wav|53|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_025.wav|25|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_150.wav|56|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_337.wav|57|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_323.wav|48|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_328.wav|102|Maybe it helps us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_159.wav|46|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_150.wav|8|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_217.wav|35|My life is in the ballet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_367.wav|62|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_366.wav|93|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_270.wav|57|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_117.wav|33|I will be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_002.wav|91|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_308.wav|21|They really shouldn't have put it out.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_139.wav|47|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_032.wav|56|It carries a double message.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_115.wav|1|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_349.wav|9|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_038.wav|87|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_140.wav|74|Don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_012.wav|68|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_148.wav|71|"They did very well."
DUMMY2/p237/p237_310.wav|61|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_398.wav|64|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_363.wav|96|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_328.wav|24|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_478.wav|48|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_210.wav|65|He suffered severe head injuries.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_031.wav|43|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_100.wav|69|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_268.wav|84|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_287.wav|39|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_043.wav|47|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_292.wav|48|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_208.wav|23|His conclusion is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_099.wav|82|It has to work.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_067.wav|70|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_225.wav|48|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_020.wav|94|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_490.wav|75|I had it before the final.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_097.wav|8|But the battle has only just begun.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_261.wav|18|Nobody has been put on trial.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_286.wav|61|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_221.wav|42|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_073.wav|106|The Government does not go far enough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_132.wav|72|Have you noticed?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_203.wav|46|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_245.wav|14|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_059.wav|7|He also has a Scottish grandfather.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_116.wav|16|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_404.wav|72|We expect a full house on the night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_305.wav|12|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_372.wav|1|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_272.wav|23|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_255.wav|11|There is great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_076.wav|100|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_165.wav|40|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_376.wav|24|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_340.wav|99|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_023.wav|41|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_261.wav|24|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_332.wav|62|We do things in an appropriate way.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_048.wav|80|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_204.wav|64|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_362.wav|34|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_100.wav|103|There are lots of these women in Finland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_411.wav|87|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_190.wav|24|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_014.wav|44|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_253.wav|16|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_211.wav|8|I am very realistic about these things.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_322.wav|89|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_160.wav|66|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_257.wav|35|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_236.wav|68|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_415.wav|78|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_299.wav|4|They're not always the same person.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_421.wav|1|We will do so again.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_140.wav|100|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_066.wav|74|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_223.wav|12|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_171.wav|25|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_057.wav|73|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_190.wav|93|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_120.wav|25|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_162.wav|61|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_182.wav|13|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_010.wav|10|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_109.wav|47|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_389.wav|103|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_212.wav|18|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_366.wav|98|Who wouldn't do it?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_009.wav|96|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_271.wav|92|We're playing away from home and that's it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_043.wav|80|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_309.wav|41|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_226.wav|97|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_288.wav|3|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_238.wav|1|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_014.wav|104|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_357.wav|62|It's better to be happy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_460.wav|24|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_240.wav|13|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_254.wav|51|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_348.wav|51|For me, it was a shattering experience.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_284.wav|102|We said, What do you mean?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_340.wav|8|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_393.wav|89|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_150.wav|98|It's good for the city.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_367.wav|91|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_299.wav|99|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_227.wav|19|That figure will always remain with me.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_245.wav|82|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_324.wav|77|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_255.wav|53|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_052.wav|6|But real life is not like that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_142.wav|31|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_213.wav|9|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_061.wav|102|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_142.wav|22|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_325.wav|61|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_099.wav|2|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_351.wav|60|The most important thing was to win today.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_049.wav|99|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_348.wav|50|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_019.wav|28|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_231.wav|17|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_104.wav|59|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_318.wav|24|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_019.wav|44|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_287.wav|11|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_173.wav|93|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_119.wav|29|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_240.wav|20|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_109.wav|68|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_178.wav|106|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_012.wav|104|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_395.wav|58|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_116.wav|68|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_184.wav|102|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_399.wav|18|It is about more than Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_028.wav|94|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_182.wav|35|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_067.wav|48|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_076.wav|88|You see - this business is a good one.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_334.wav|72|They were unable to revive him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_009.wav|78|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_207.wav|13|She was close to suicide at one stage.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_184.wav|70|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_147.wav|90|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_157.wav|33|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_177.wav|49|Teams are always interesting to watch.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_410.wav|85|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_218.wav|58|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_003.wav|83|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_360.wav|45|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_111.wav|104|We have great confidence in Derek.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_327.wav|0|You are looking at him.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_270.wav|2|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_148.wav|0|There was a definite prejudice.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_411.wav|22|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_400.wav|29|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_272.wav|28|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_262.wav|34|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_111.wav|37|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_015.wav|106|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_201.wav|25|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_236.wav|92|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_345.wav|10|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_024.wav|83|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_174.wav|36|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_386.wav|53|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_254.wav|42|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_116.wav|98|They never got into the show this time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_363.wav|55|That seems highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_350.wav|85|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_300.wav|66|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_319.wav|50|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_250.wav|67|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_262.wav|96|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_364.wav|7|It's too horrible to think.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_171.wav|97|This is excellent value for money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_292.wav|47|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_308.wav|102|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_048.wav|86|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_350.wav|95|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_025.wav|74|It would be nice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_251.wav|98|The family baton is handed on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_052.wav|67|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_351.wav|36|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_282.wav|5|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_137.wav|35|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_420.wav|85|They responded in the most positive way.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_121.wav|10|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_012.wav|74|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_120.wav|59|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_200.wav|3|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_333.wav|82|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_161.wav|47|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_052.wav|15|Hasn't let anyone down?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_243.wav|1|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_013.wav|23|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_162.wav|72|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_374.wav|35|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_210.wav|21|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_105.wav|46|That's why he visited.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_148.wav|18|Sadly, he has a point.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_177.wav|4|What kind of festival is proposed?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_010.wav|101|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_089.wav|76|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_121.wav|88|It is part of their job.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_138.wav|107|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_128.wav|61|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_136.wav|13|We cannot lose it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_190.wav|100|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_372.wav|99|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_262.wav|62|That would be a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_310.wav|89|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_143.wav|57|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_368.wav|69|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_173.wav|57|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_321.wav|43|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_053.wav|26|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_254.wav|94|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_218.wav|28|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_235.wav|77|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_184.wav|48|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_176.wav|107|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_459.wav|14|The damage is all inside.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_365.wav|84|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_025.wav|42|But it's been kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_118.wav|56|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_271.wav|45|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_047.wav|15|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_410.wav|34|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_114.wav|19|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_142.wav|84|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_149.wav|94|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_349.wav|104|I'm not going to change from it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_482.wav|65|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_370.wav|54|There has been a big change in defence.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_143.wav|86|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_286.wav|91|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_326.wav|38|The law should be changed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_342.wav|47|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_101.wav|71|"Oil embargo endorsed."
DUMMY2/p252/p252_152.wav|55|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_103.wav|97|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_321.wav|68|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_279.wav|11|It was the first time they met.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_229.wav|79|I just want him to win a tournament.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_078.wav|52|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_103.wav|38|We should just say no.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_162.wav|55|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_115.wav|18|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_099.wav|84|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_352.wav|29|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_258.wav|75|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_336.wav|52|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_030.wav|39|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_301.wav|31|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_294.wav|81|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_376.wav|1|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_157.wav|31|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_089.wav|78|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_092.wav|84|They have a further report to make in March.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_071.wav|77|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_189.wav|67|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_309.wav|26|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_304.wav|39|In the end, it was no choice.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_046.wav|33|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_164.wav|92|The voters are our masters.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_329.wav|84|He told the court.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_002.wav|95|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_056.wav|49|I don't want to hear any excuses.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_366.wav|85|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_181.wav|18|Within three days he was dead.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_195.wav|67|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_197.wav|70|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_057.wav|46|It will come up here.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_359.wav|96|She is free.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_292.wav|32|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_329.wav|36|There is no shortage of farmers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_455.wav|75|He deserved a red card.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_214.wav|63|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_272.wav|40|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_247.wav|79|But those days are dead and gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_366.wav|9|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_005.wav|6|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_296.wav|41|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_099.wav|36|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_067.wav|4|He is a visionary.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_255.wav|27|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_485.wav|75|It happens on an annual basis.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_293.wav|80|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_214.wav|86|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_330.wav|38|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_262.wav|41|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_202.wav|72|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_032.wav|61|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_235.wav|28|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_351.wav|46|So now you know.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_151.wav|82|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_317.wav|90|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_182.wav|11|He had planned to sell it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_090.wav|48|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_008.wav|97|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_473.wav|65|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_155.wav|102|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_437.wav|32|The Festival is prepared to help.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_232.wav|5|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_372.wav|21|And if he hasn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_020.wav|95|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_212.wav|43|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_302.wav|27|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_287.wav|21|I believe in debate and dialogue.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_040.wav|4|We cannot go on in this fashion.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_110.wav|88|We could do a lot worse.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_034.wav|25|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_009.wav|25|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_162.wav|85|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_248.wav|7|His background is firmly in venture capital.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_125.wav|100|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_203.wav|62|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_367.wav|107|It is normal for me.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_119.wav|0|I am the Son of Sam.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_236.wav|7|My daughter is an adult.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_143.wav|42|We believe that the reason is poverty.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_159.wav|82|However, he did not stay there very long.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_204.wav|7|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_081.wav|67|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_193.wav|32|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_073.wav|94|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_291.wav|48|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_392.wav|51|We've been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_371.wav|46|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_263.wav|90|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_005.wav|106|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_127.wav|42|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_280.wav|40|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_018.wav|31|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_386.wav|51|I can't believe what has happened.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_401.wav|35|You will not feel a thing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_086.wav|49|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_131.wav|55|Britain's role was to stop it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_252.wav|97|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_301.wav|0|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_031.wav|2|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_270.wav|44|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_379.wav|18|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_024.wav|89|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_399.wav|62|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_262.wav|79|It's been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_293.wav|63|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_055.wav|5|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_020.wav|68|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_239.wav|67|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_383.wav|8|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_307.wav|25|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_160.wav|45|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_216.wav|49|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_335.wav|97|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_207.wav|40|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_103.wav|2|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_019.wav|56|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_249.wav|68|We can just get on with our game.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_110.wav|43|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_221.wav|25|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_155.wav|45|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_150.wav|68|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_455.wav|95|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_085.wav|91|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_178.wav|21|I am looking forward to this film.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_062.wav|98|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_267.wav|66|She became very good at it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_271.wav|16|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_404.wav|106|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_006.wav|29|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_132.wav|65|This commitment should be built upon.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_135.wav|1|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_101.wav|33|In part that reflected the times.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_041.wav|105|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_082.wav|52|It's been a great evening for us.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_112.wav|33|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_373.wav|60|Or is it?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_344.wav|38|He loved his children.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_145.wav|99|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_324.wav|5|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_278.wav|22|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_239.wav|1|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_350.wav|94|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_421.wav|89|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_283.wav|66|Are you in this movie?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_479.wav|65|We were given a break.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_111.wav|12|I'm not a diva.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_212.wav|91|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_165.wav|78|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_221.wav|33|We just want them home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_027.wav|29|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_321.wav|84|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_330.wav|60|I have no idea.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_286.wav|33|That was not the norm.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_383.wav|40|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_048.wav|36|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_086.wav|20|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_333.wav|73|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_222.wav|59|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_073.wav|35|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_354.wav|89|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_021.wav|58|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_144.wav|61|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_211.wav|62|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_024.wav|3|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_180.wav|62|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_040.wav|27|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_410.wav|49|Courtenay took over on tour.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_165.wav|45|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_035.wav|102|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_258.wav|59|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_007.wav|36|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_214.wav|12|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_075.wav|52|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_020.wav|11|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_129.wav|37|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_400.wav|32|It has only been rumours.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_115.wav|101|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_319.wav|17|The campaign was raucous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_122.wav|62|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_218.wav|30|They could go no further forward.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_068.wav|103|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_195.wav|36|And this game is all about belief.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_081.wav|84|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_136.wav|1|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_075.wav|83|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_157.wav|76|I'm not blaming audiences.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_170.wav|24|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_059.wav|84|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_097.wav|69|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_026.wav|39|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_451.wav|14|But you can go beyond that condition.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_275.wav|18|This time it really could happen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_255.wav|37|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_264.wav|53|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_388.wav|105|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_264.wav|107|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_163.wav|40|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_191.wav|6|That is European law.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_043.wav|107|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_040.wav|7|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_193.wav|60|There are some good people in there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_282.wav|21|Everything is so new.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_029.wav|21|It is a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_208.wav|4|Everything in the symphony is there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_044.wav|107|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_146.wav|79|I want my mum.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_079.wav|39|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_066.wav|27|They are real.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_103.wav|40|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_320.wav|103|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_229.wav|24|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_251.wav|12|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_153.wav|56|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_174.wav|91|What, then, is the real thing?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_162.wav|37|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_451.wav|39|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_086.wav|78|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_102.wav|64|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_266.wav|42|England against France is always a big game.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_271.wav|57|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_052.wav|56|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_067.wav|103|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_407.wav|34|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_069.wav|11|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_343.wav|48|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_234.wav|24|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_402.wav|19|This fight is not going to go away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_338.wav|70|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_014.wav|32|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_183.wav|32|They bought the property four years ago.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_172.wav|15|That is for certain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_442.wav|65|WE all watch the same match.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_196.wav|19|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_080.wav|66|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_400.wav|64|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_074.wav|13|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_034.wav|40|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_139.wav|35|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_151.wav|94|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_149.wav|27|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_165.wav|57|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_125.wav|22|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_370.wav|107|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_027.wav|23|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_236.wav|55|There is a good reason for this.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_420.wav|51|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_288.wav|107|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_250.wav|0|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_185.wav|17|There was even a joke.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_409.wav|6|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_342.wav|65|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_066.wav|14|We could soon be in that same position!)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_360.wav|60|There was no-one of the required standard.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_082.wav|57|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_202.wav|55|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_005.wav|48|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_342.wav|1|It is like being a qualifier again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_103.wav|72|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_241.wav|97|Surely the panel was interested?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_010.wav|85|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_305.wav|25|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_053.wav|58|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_374.wav|13|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_178.wav|1|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_189.wav|75|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_014.wav|92|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_386.wav|26|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_231.wav|14|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_423.wav|1|I have no problem with that.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_221.wav|90|We will be victorious.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_071.wav|21|We played too deeply.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_145.wav|25|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_013.wav|94|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_289.wav|105|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_103.wav|48|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_334.wav|31|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_177.wav|94|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_138.wav|42|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_018.wav|66|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_169.wav|69|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_190.wav|25|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_364.wav|87|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_051.wav|83|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_462.wav|65|They're interested only in profits.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_089.wav|104|Seven British members of the club are missing.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_289.wav|71|"Sunday's game was not a trial."
DUMMY2/p225/p225_108.wav|101|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_213.wav|4|It had to be more flexible.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_163.wav|61|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_361.wav|52|The institute board will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_209.wav|50|We are a new department.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_293.wav|93|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_112.wav|94|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_258.wav|69|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_140.wav|102|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_388.wav|56|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_203.wav|55|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_048.wav|98|The crowd was waiting.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_052.wav|33|I won't go back.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_394.wav|58|If there is default.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_305.wav|97|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_134.wav|34|It was no more than they deserved.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_047.wav|24|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_048.wav|45|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_184.wav|37|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_323.wav|75|A lot has been written.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_099.wav|57|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_292.wav|104|This could also affect the sentencing.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_269.wav|73|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_183.wav|48|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_236.wav|57|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_397.wav|98|She is having an affair with his partner.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_350.wav|15|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_416.wav|38|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_145.wav|96|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_374.wav|41|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_179.wav|47|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_100.wav|40|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_121.wav|95|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_137.wav|14|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_260.wav|78|That is not the case in Europe.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_187.wav|93|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_194.wav|88|And there are different perspectives.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_107.wav|104|I've never felt affection for Emu.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_038.wav|40|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_046.wav|49|Rangers deserved to beat us.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_300.wav|55|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_387.wav|78|He will be difficult to replace.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_095.wav|18|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_176.wav|86|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_155.wav|59|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_138.wav|27|He should resign.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_353.wav|44|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_156.wav|79|The driver just insulted me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_054.wav|33|We could not compete with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_354.wav|81|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_077.wav|34|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_012.wav|12|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_074.wav|91|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_369.wav|53|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_166.wav|42|He died from multiple injuries.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_028.wav|80|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_057.wav|17|All of us know it exists.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_007.wav|1|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_086.wav|55|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_096.wav|47|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_212.wav|71|"His death was a tragic accident."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_327.wav|5|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_115.wav|31|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_145.wav|83|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_132.wav|25|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_353.wav|43|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_219.wav|53|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_007.wav|31|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_273.wav|3|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_372.wav|76|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_050.wav|97|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_410.wav|32|I've had a wonderful career.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_258.wav|97|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_193.wav|90|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_325.wav|51|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_340.wav|64|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_242.wav|93|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_199.wav|77|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_049.wav|79|I am the fastest player on the course.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_316.wav|69|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_150.wav|15|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_284.wav|61|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_323.wav|92|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_168.wav|88|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_209.wav|30|There is a great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_162.wav|45|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_179.wav|83|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_021.wav|72|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_203.wav|18|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_333.wav|75|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_302.wav|87|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_054.wav|105|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_134.wav|96|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_212.wav|75|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_185.wav|96|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_359.wav|58|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_187.wav|70|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_254.wav|97|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_395.wav|22|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_253.wav|25|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_074.wav|78|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_095.wav|86|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_210.wav|17|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_388.wav|0|The results will take second place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_380.wav|74|They are expected to be released today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_424.wav|74|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_360.wav|100|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_172.wav|6|The German had a point to make.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_266.wav|53|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_184.wav|35|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_353.wav|3|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_424.wav|20|I chose to make a film.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_256.wav|88|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_184.wav|87|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_401.wav|100|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_225.wav|22|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_205.wav|70|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_161.wav|55|I told them during their morning break.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_068.wav|96|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_233.wav|78|There is a lot of concern.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_022.wav|106|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_226.wav|50|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_221.wav|52|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_042.wav|107|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_208.wav|8|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_150.wav|95|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_095.wav|49|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_375.wav|19|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_193.wav|59|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_245.wav|56|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_210.wav|22|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_338.wav|87|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_028.wav|25|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_137.wav|5|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_066.wav|88|He leaves a beat.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_195.wav|23|We will do so again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_448.wav|63|The couple had one daughter.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_322.wav|75|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_220.wav|106|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_260.wav|71|"He was popular."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_306.wav|45|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_116.wav|14|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_185.wav|87|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_335.wav|94|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_253.wav|107|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_113.wav|106|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_088.wav|102|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_295.wav|72|But it could have been written for her.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_111.wav|21|But we can't have a casino.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_078.wav|107|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_405.wav|7|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_239.wav|52|Jim was down there with his wife.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_006.wav|37|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_455.wav|39|However, one has arrived in the post.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_257.wav|79|I thought they were just excited.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_152.wav|77|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_098.wav|73|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_268.wav|48|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_031.wav|96|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_396.wav|27|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_353.wav|38|What would you do if you didn't work?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_295.wav|95|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_287.wav|86|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_206.wav|102|It is turning that way all across Europe.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_172.wav|49|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_280.wav|6|The gap is closing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_332.wav|36|But the Farmer is bemused.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_001.wav|98|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_136.wav|31|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_207.wav|35|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_184.wav|60|I did not see anything to begin with.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_141.wav|21|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_124.wav|95|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_152.wav|101|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_086.wav|92|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_259.wav|60|It makes me feel difficult.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_388.wav|51|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_047.wav|103|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_105.wav|107|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_066.wav|20|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_373.wav|63|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_465.wav|7|But we have built a platform for next season.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_131.wav|52|He's got to look after himself now.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_034.wav|71|"It's a matter of balance."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_395.wav|75|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_385.wav|102|That's the kind of thing that counts.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_171.wav|93|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_211.wav|47|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_022.wav|77|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_215.wav|34|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_033.wav|68|I think they should have more respect.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_049.wav|29|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_021.wav|83|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_350.wav|61|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_077.wav|10|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_159.wav|5|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_210.wav|103|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_151.wav|51|Don't even bother applying.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_194.wav|82|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_213.wav|71|"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_163.wav|34|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_255.wav|61|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_068.wav|11|This time it is official.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_051.wav|24|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_301.wav|67|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_035.wav|7|Because he was born in England.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_017.wav|10|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_141.wav|0|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_322.wav|43|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_041.wav|97|Overall, however, these were also down.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_045.wav|88|And that's the trouble with this business.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_124.wav|51|There are a lot of examples.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_310.wav|20|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_003.wav|28|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_016.wav|99|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_101.wav|96|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_088.wav|43|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_264.wav|70|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_189.wav|30|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_077.wav|48|He phoned the number in the brochure.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_359.wav|43|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_333.wav|94|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_245.wav|84|I know I'm in a very special position.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_322.wav|11|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_261.wav|19|He was in contention almost every week.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_242.wav|28|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_083.wav|9|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_295.wav|1|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_260.wav|30|I started on a fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_154.wav|103|The whole experience has left me bitter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_405.wav|11|They have not given them the evidence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_237.wav|48|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_193.wav|36|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_006.wav|78|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_129.wav|41|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_394.wav|8|It runs until the beginning of June.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_204.wav|14|They have the cash and the fire power.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_120.wav|9|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_108.wav|41|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_068.wav|63|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_331.wav|105|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_016.wav|100|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_070.wav|95|The Government should be ashamed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_076.wav|80|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_094.wav|23|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_098.wav|12|There are a huge number of arts.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_059.wav|65|Why do it otherwise?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_264.wav|94|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_181.wav|76|I hope we do.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_124.wav|8|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_197.wav|68|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_156.wav|24|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_174.wav|18|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_349.wav|48|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_050.wav|55|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_254.wav|44|I learned a lot from her.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_125.wav|0|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_207.wav|104|It will take some time to establish.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_116.wav|13|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_268.wav|20|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_122.wav|73|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_092.wav|50|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_337.wav|77|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_203.wav|53|Full details are expected to be released in June.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_294.wav|100|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_005.wav|14|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p308/p308_337.wav|107|There was no hint of bravado.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_393.wav|47|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_079.wav|103|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_278.wav|57|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_153.wav|72|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_113.wav|26|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_033.wav|57|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_338.wav|16|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_103.wav|90|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_139.wav|26|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_266.wav|12|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_159.wav|91|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_110.wav|59|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_039.wav|102|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_026.wav|71|"But it failed."
DUMMY2/p340/p340_072.wav|74|However, that is just for starters.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_086.wav|47|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_244.wav|94|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_298.wav|96|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_007.wav|91|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_449.wav|36|She came to the Highland Show.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_127.wav|81|The people will come.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_234.wav|86|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_102.wav|58|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_259.wav|3|It was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_205.wav|24|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_279.wav|2|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_100.wav|57|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_075.wav|63|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_299.wav|7|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_211.wav|104|I love this job.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_197.wav|11|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_355.wav|91|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_235.wav|38|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_228.wav|65|He talks too much.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_030.wav|52|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_271.wav|3|Well, it was certainly different.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_090.wav|100|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_008.wav|66|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_250.wav|39|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_312.wav|68|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_372.wav|53|He really played us into a corner.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_277.wav|44|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_144.wav|48|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_250.wav|87|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_348.wav|6|The world is being invited to visit.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_221.wav|69|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_102.wav|7|The selection process is still at a very early stage.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_237.wav|70|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_271.wav|23|I was furious about it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_368.wav|95|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_151.wav|77|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_283.wav|35|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_114.wav|50|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_047.wav|10|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_317.wav|31|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_236.wav|78|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_295.wav|49|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_031.wav|41|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_052.wav|20|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_232.wav|19|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_470.wav|65|It is an industry failure.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_255.wav|1|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_086.wav|60|This year the exercise is being repeated.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_312.wav|32|Everything in golf is a balance.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_271.wav|21|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_399.wav|106|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_075.wav|28|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_124.wav|43|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_256.wav|95|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_152.wav|36|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_371.wav|36|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_334.wav|94|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_072.wav|66|It is time to give her a rest.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_141.wav|12|That's because we work hard at it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_281.wav|106|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_006.wav|76|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_145.wav|55|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_240.wav|63|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_314.wav|94|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_050.wav|77|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_071.wav|65|But I had never been in a theatre.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_364.wav|104|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_099.wav|56|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_085.wav|67|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_138.wav|16|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_440.wav|95|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_164.wav|20|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_131.wav|68|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_304.wav|36|We are not doing the Today programme.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_319.wav|89|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_190.wav|71|"Last night was a key episode."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_323.wav|15|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_437.wav|75|He said current trading was strong.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_236.wav|85|Where will the elderly go then?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_209.wav|34|I am pretty careful with money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_170.wav|29|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_255.wav|74|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_001.wav|86|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_394.wav|19|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_039.wav|13|And the newspapers were full of it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_274.wav|68|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_035.wav|53|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_351.wav|56|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_070.wav|17|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_077.wav|107|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_186.wav|28|He was all blackened.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_166.wav|64|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_203.wav|95|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_167.wav|87|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_230.wav|106|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_057.wav|30|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_180.wav|85|We played better after the break.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_045.wav|95|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_359.wav|72|Darren is very, very good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_212.wav|41|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_043.wav|4|I knew my contract was up this year.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_232.wav|48|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_405.wav|55|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_120.wav|50|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_227.wav|40|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_141.wav|69|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_352.wav|23|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_006.wav|46|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_236.wav|103|It really was a masterful innings.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_271.wav|73|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_356.wav|25|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_123.wav|91|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_354.wav|100|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_071.wav|38|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_051.wav|102|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_233.wav|17|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_215.wav|0|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_069.wav|92|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_049.wav|44|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_077.wav|62|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_014.wav|31|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_003.wav|99|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_105.wav|59|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_213.wav|104|We are very, very pleased with the response.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_154.wav|74|I've never regretted my decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_082.wav|92|Or is it the European approach?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_300.wav|80|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_189.wav|34|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_198.wav|51|His director of football is leaving.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_053.wav|57|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_133.wav|7|Before it was an ordeal.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_411.wav|74|And it will be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_297.wav|33|You are going to go to jail.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_047.wav|54|They were urged to get themselves in order.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_191.wav|56|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_308.wav|91|They will have to make changes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_148.wav|29|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_481.wav|48|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_405.wav|65|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_338.wav|49|I put pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_055.wav|100|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_351.wav|62|It was a horrible thing to happen.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_210.wav|100|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_026.wav|5|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_113.wav|75|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_313.wav|64|I'm not blaming audiences.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_271.wav|61|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_056.wav|29|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_299.wav|33|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_253.wav|26|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_397.wav|39|The thing is to recognise that chance.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_248.wav|68|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_117.wav|10|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_021.wav|104|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_358.wav|0|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_041.wav|69|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_008.wav|35|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_029.wav|30|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_263.wav|87|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_360.wav|29|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_239.wav|45|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_122.wav|28|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_016.wav|107|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_100.wav|22|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_292.wav|105|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_141.wav|25|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_238.wav|67|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_254.wav|59|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_142.wav|97|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_088.wav|24|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_054.wav|64|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_070.wav|9|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_063.wav|17|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_032.wav|37|The staff are very good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_368.wav|52|It was a goal which came from nothing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_392.wav|14|Rugby has an extended run.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_088.wav|46|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_075.wav|17|That was then and this is now.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_277.wav|47|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_341.wav|27|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_001.wav|48|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_033.wav|85|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_236.wav|54|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_244.wav|6|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_022.wav|79|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_007.wav|49|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_034.wav|52|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_365.wav|63|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_321.wav|87|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_178.wav|51|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_158.wav|97|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_307.wav|23|We've just got to work a bit better.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_115.wav|16|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_299.wav|0|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_143.wav|1|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_062.wav|37|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_153.wav|15|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_326.wav|11|We cannot go on like this.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_415.wav|85|I hope you don't regret it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_029.wav|70|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_151.wav|104|It's like a score in some ways.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_320.wav|41|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_146.wav|38|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_404.wav|35|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_071.wav|35|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_178.wav|102|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_130.wav|18|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_188.wav|81|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_071.wav|71|"They do not work for Glasgow City Council."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_263.wav|88|I've seen it work already.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_128.wav|99|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_387.wav|85|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_251.wav|75|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_361.wav|5|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_123.wav|52|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_391.wav|19|There are a number of possible outcomes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_403.wav|105|It doesn't always work that way.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_189.wav|81|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_229.wav|95|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_379.wav|85|However, we let them back into the game.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_137.wav|46|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_338.wav|56|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_114.wav|70|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_086.wav|31|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_349.wav|23|The family also declined to discuss the case.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_126.wav|3|He wanted to record the group.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_028.wav|101|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_001.wav|65|Please call Stella.  )
DUMMY2/p231/p231_354.wav|50|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_059.wav|100|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_105.wav|98|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_024.wav|90|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_207.wav|1|I think the euro has slipped.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_289.wav|15|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_219.wav|44|It has made me feel good.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_045.wav|64|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_015.wav|92|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_030.wav|44|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_028.wav|30|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_108.wav|62|Then there was her childhood.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_062.wav|2|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_364.wav|37|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_011.wav|45|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_199.wav|10|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_282.wav|105|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_016.wav|62|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_270.wav|90|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_035.wav|81|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_299.wav|86|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_116.wav|50|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_259.wav|95|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_004.wav|73|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_140.wav|103|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_003.wav|84|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_024.wav|68|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_242.wav|64|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_246.wav|93|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_298.wav|2|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_279.wav|0|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_265.wav|36|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_028.wav|76|I intend to raise the matter there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_280.wav|104|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_189.wav|29|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_164.wav|91|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_101.wav|3|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_070.wav|100|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_073.wav|80|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_295.wav|92|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_056.wav|86|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_406.wav|69|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_242.wav|24|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_030.wav|14|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_091.wav|70|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_053.wav|14|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_400.wav|48|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_042.wav|16|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_407.wav|85|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_052.wav|4|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_186.wav|16|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_013.wav|66|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_432.wav|63|They did the right thing.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_149.wav|77|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_088.wav|9|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_164.wav|13|These are serious matters.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_038.wav|23|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_361.wav|42|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_020.wav|27|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_075.wav|84|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_109.wav|78|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_368.wav|31|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_002.wav|83|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_233.wav|34|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_467.wav|7|They offer a kind of narrative.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_046.wav|82|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_164.wav|44|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_235.wav|94|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_020.wav|82|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_363.wav|85|Two people have died.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_261.wav|51|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_252.wav|105|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_008.wav|46|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_047.wav|55|That's what set him apart.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_061.wav|21|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_336.wav|11|He has two children.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_084.wav|7|It is normal for me.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_258.wav|57|They are real.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_222.wav|25|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_332.wav|69|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_065.wav|83|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_317.wav|92|It's a member of your family.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_357.wav|87|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_026.wav|85|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_243.wav|92|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_247.wav|33|It got no better.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_228.wav|16|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_399.wav|85|I think we believed the tie was won.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_323.wav|33|Others are expected to do so soon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_125.wav|107|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_091.wav|26|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_345.wav|100|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_195.wav|92|We have all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_124.wav|69|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_017.wav|37|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_312.wav|41|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_402.wav|75|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_090.wav|20|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_146.wav|80|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_312.wav|94|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_156.wav|0|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_190.wav|89|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_127.wav|86|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_095.wav|38|I thought they played very well.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_078.wav|89|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_311.wav|33|We don't believe anything anymore.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_224.wav|20|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_313.wav|69|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_022.wav|20|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_139.wav|59|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_046.wav|43|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_117.wav|92|The Scots are, however, in good company.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_308.wav|93|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_340.wav|76|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_006.wav|94|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_322.wav|68|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_037.wav|85|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_199.wav|16|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_042.wav|40|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_405.wav|78|It's all been about the basics of the business.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_321.wav|41|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_036.wav|7|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_008.wav|102|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_329.wav|66|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_296.wav|15|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_142.wav|4|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_131.wav|35|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_179.wav|38|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_204.wav|21|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_264.wav|83|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_055.wav|4|They should go ahead as normal.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_184.wav|82|That in itself is an erotic experience.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_065.wav|9|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_141.wav|36|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_145.wav|81|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_158.wav|44|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_381.wav|40|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_057.wav|106|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_222.wav|101|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_250.wav|96|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_257.wav|12|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_332.wav|66|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_070.wav|51|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_141.wav|23|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_268.wav|87|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_132.wav|67|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_184.wav|12|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_020.wav|78|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_339.wav|35|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_377.wav|41|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_113.wav|27|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_097.wav|76|But Allen is deadly serious.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_302.wav|33|I would love to see it back there.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_009.wav|77|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_227.wav|86|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_281.wav|20|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_266.wav|91|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_249.wav|26|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_050.wav|38|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_192.wav|57|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_072.wav|92|I had no choice but to leave.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_424.wav|89|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_333.wav|41|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_088.wav|12|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_071.wav|87|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_293.wav|87|The Royal Highland was no exception.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_003.wav|102|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_299.wav|78|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_311.wav|58|We are in a learning curve.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_209.wav|91|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_331.wav|42|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_014.wav|94|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_255.wav|31|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_388.wav|27|They deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_269.wav|81|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_326.wav|74|But don't just take my word for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_172.wav|56|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_119.wav|36|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_403.wav|79|What sort of man is that?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_306.wav|51|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_290.wav|52|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_167.wav|77|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_209.wav|41|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_394.wav|60|I had to win this race.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_377.wav|51|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_359.wav|47|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_265.wav|3|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_225.wav|4|And it paid off.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_307.wav|22|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_028.wav|47|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_022.wav|13|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_140.wav|24|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_076.wav|17|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_421.wav|63|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_185.wav|77|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_336.wav|76|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_171.wav|62|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_407.wav|16|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_174.wav|3|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_326.wav|63|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_051.wav|16|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_297.wav|32|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_101.wav|82|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_362.wav|66|Scotland is losing business.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_105.wav|38|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_070.wav|44|Repayment is not part of the game.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_279.wav|79|No reason was given.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_258.wav|86|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_124.wav|21|We reckon we can do very well.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_354.wav|22|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_272.wav|31|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_256.wav|19|The reason is partly because of tradition.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_044.wav|36|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_050.wav|105|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_369.wav|67|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_186.wav|54|Angola was a really hard place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_415.wav|36|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_177.wav|19|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_191.wav|52|You are not long home from work.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_212.wav|14|His injury was completely random.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_094.wav|68|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_112.wav|23|There is no musical background in his family.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_193.wav|37|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_027.wav|43|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_157.wav|18|I'm not fit for anything else.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_150.wav|19|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_109.wav|92|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_347.wav|69|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_061.wav|70|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_154.wav|3|There is a spring in the step.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_265.wav|106|I would have been shot dead in bed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_345.wav|69|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_023.wav|67|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_219.wav|104|Then they killed another three.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_358.wav|24|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_344.wav|21|They will be up for it for sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_139.wav|107|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_378.wav|70|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_048.wav|14|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_230.wav|4|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_268.wav|106|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_332.wav|28|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_119.wav|62|What's the theme?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_333.wav|83|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_442.wav|37|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_153.wav|38|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_136.wav|48|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_182.wav|78|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_061.wav|58|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_352.wav|85|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_273.wav|62|It is the icing on the cake.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_305.wav|16|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_376.wav|107|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_027.wav|52|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_012.wav|53|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_208.wav|2|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_154.wav|38|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_464.wav|48|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_092.wav|45|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_099.wav|67|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_086.wav|40|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_072.wav|30|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_223.wav|18|Without doubt, they can win the title.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_164.wav|100|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_201.wav|101|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_194.wav|18|This will have to change.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_353.wav|80|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_045.wav|74|I have lost all confidence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_252.wav|56|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_227.wav|18|I called it right.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_303.wav|94|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_233.wav|33|We've never seen so many.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_412.wav|34|Last night, the row continued.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_256.wav|73|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_290.wav|95|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_227.wav|90|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_306.wav|25|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_197.wav|80|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_291.wav|77|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_349.wav|61|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_287.wav|42|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_379.wav|89|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_025.wav|64|He needed seven hours of surgery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_252.wav|18|I was very surprised.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_032.wav|55|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_345.wav|54|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_085.wav|8|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_282.wav|55|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_121.wav|34|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_052.wav|90|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_107.wav|30|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_293.wav|28|We have to adapt to this level.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_129.wav|40|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_160.wav|54|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_261.wav|80|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_004.wav|97|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_065.wav|23|Let us hope so.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_189.wav|41|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_045.wav|96|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_171.wav|106|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_102.wav|90|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_261.wav|44|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_193.wav|103|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_138.wav|93|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_253.wav|8|Everything depends on the weather.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_215.wav|102|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_166.wav|58|And does it?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_024.wav|12|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_093.wav|17|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_332.wav|9|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_224.wav|94|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_278.wav|82|But that is about to change.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_053.wav|96|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_132.wav|57|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_323.wav|27|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_197.wav|15|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_055.wav|94|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_321.wav|93|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_014.wav|5|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_066.wav|45|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_278.wav|87|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_363.wav|42|So, where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_257.wav|73|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_387.wav|84|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_234.wav|80|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_166.wav|60|A good actor doesn't think.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_427.wav|56|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_328.wav|66|It is a question of balance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_133.wav|107|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_443.wav|75|We would have concerns about that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_012.wav|103|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_012.wav|99|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_360.wav|39|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_004.wav|94|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_178.wav|104|Harry will be up for it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_066.wav|22|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_103.wav|30|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_304.wav|42|That, too, was over two years ago.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_395.wav|10|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_112.wav|0|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_204.wav|65|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_374.wav|74|There are not enough of them.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_319.wav|37|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_208.wav|48|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_286.wav|79|And she is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_002.wav|29|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_192.wav|30|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_067.wav|25|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_029.wav|85|We have worked hard.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_067.wav|88|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_277.wav|18|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_337.wav|51|The whole thing would be perfect.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_182.wav|74|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_402.wav|66|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_061.wav|50|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_265.wav|37|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_088.wav|86|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_351.wav|29|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_256.wav|84|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_304.wav|29|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_073.wav|59|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_347.wav|10|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_189.wav|89|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_273.wav|8|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_227.wav|77|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_018.wav|92|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_015.wav|33|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_387.wav|50|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_361.wav|76|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_276.wav|76|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_150.wav|55|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_025.wav|50|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_153.wav|36|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_376.wav|25|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_354.wav|24|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_186.wav|5|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_126.wav|55|Gold admitted as much.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_212.wav|105|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_338.wav|19|They've been wonderful to me.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_175.wav|0|I would not count on it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_243.wav|11|We can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_031.wav|29|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_163.wav|75|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_319.wav|12|I tend to not look back.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_058.wav|99|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_036.wav|107|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_357.wav|59|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_069.wav|52|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_067.wav|36|It is a real problem.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_225.wav|76|This was not an easy meeting for me.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_277.wav|77|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_266.wav|51|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_011.wav|87|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_080.wav|106|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_385.wav|23|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_049.wav|7|I had come back from London.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_054.wav|70|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_225.wav|1|But it's just great to have won.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_291.wav|35|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_124.wav|7|It is too pretty, it is too small.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_311.wav|34|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_200.wav|77|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_062.wav|66|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_040.wav|9|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_091.wav|27|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_233.wav|26|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_086.wav|3|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_350.wav|74|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_289.wav|22|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_002.wav|3|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_068.wav|30|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_097.wav|54|My grandparents were terrified.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_046.wav|14|It's not a swimming pool out there.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_031.wav|50|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_351.wav|66|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_100.wav|80|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_095.wav|83|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_411.wav|0|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_106.wav|39|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_131.wav|33|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_230.wav|13|If only he knew himself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_177.wav|1|I have no battle with the Scots.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_391.wav|10|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_341.wav|41|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_081.wav|18|It all happened so suddenly.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_283.wav|45|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_341.wav|91|I am not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_177.wav|36|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_344.wav|24|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_173.wav|13|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_241.wav|103|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_367.wav|57|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_387.wav|38|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_139.wav|4|They got the job done.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_067.wav|58|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_154.wav|56|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_006.wav|65|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p280/p280_113.wav|52|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_109.wav|1|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_291.wav|23|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_197.wav|28|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_076.wav|74|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_263.wav|74|People were very confused.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_206.wav|91|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_370.wav|14|He had no access to the database.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_359.wav|101|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_327.wav|94|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_441.wav|7|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_320.wav|65|The performance continues to improve.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_043.wav|6|His film is not.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_061.wav|45|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_268.wav|7|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_346.wav|20|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_201.wav|98|It wouldn't go off.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_480.wav|48|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_083.wav|23|However, my position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_251.wav|79|That was my last game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_262.wav|45|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_230.wav|11|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_023.wav|72|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_050.wav|57|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_038.wav|13|It is just like the stock market.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_209.wav|0|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_129.wav|36|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_272.wav|15|There's always a chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_245.wav|90|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_146.wav|93|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_125.wav|84|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_093.wav|102|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_280.wav|53|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_138.wav|36|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_286.wav|87|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_051.wav|5|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_045.wav|67|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_419.wav|18|We should have been rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_295.wav|60|But it didn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_359.wav|100|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_099.wav|43|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_074.wav|102|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_050.wav|104|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_336.wav|10|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_040.wav|11|I've had a ball.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_341.wav|18|Let's not make that mistake again.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_311.wav|89|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_155.wav|23|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_418.wav|39|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_038.wav|102|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_365.wav|33|I believe she was elected unopposed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_214.wav|94|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_121.wav|72|It's something he works hard at achieving.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_249.wav|17|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_249.wav|99|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_048.wav|2|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_005.wav|26|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_059.wav|94|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_237.wav|77|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_361.wav|51|We are still going ahead with our plans.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_223.wav|21|But he kept on repeating it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_350.wav|106|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_136.wav|25|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_242.wav|15|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_331.wav|65|He had played very well.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_346.wav|39|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_310.wav|32|The rescue package is public money.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_271.wav|98|I've had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_204.wav|36|There was no way back for United after that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_028.wav|69|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_401.wav|50|She is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_348.wav|61|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_145.wav|60|What's it going to be then?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_051.wav|21|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_102.wav|43|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_088.wav|28|We have them in offices all over.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_063.wav|52|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_230.wav|91|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_287.wav|9|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_166.wav|1|It was horrible, but there is still more.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_067.wav|24|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_204.wav|91|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_274.wav|104|It's as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_200.wav|49|Next time around, it will be different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_258.wav|5|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_338.wav|92|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_317.wav|19|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_160.wav|94|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_023.wav|6|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_065.wav|2|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_064.wav|88|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_235.wav|82|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_046.wav|71|"That should do it."
DUMMY2/p249/p249_105.wav|80|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_196.wav|69|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_033.wav|72|They agree to meet.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_183.wav|84|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_302.wav|86|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_367.wav|105|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_118.wav|70|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_317.wav|55|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_042.wav|92|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_063.wav|87|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_104.wav|41|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_048.wav|25|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_281.wav|100|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_075.wav|96|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_091.wav|91|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_127.wav|21|We are not with you.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_292.wav|70|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_338.wav|17|We don't know the scale of need.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_208.wav|103|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_141.wav|63|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_412.wav|19|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_009.wav|94|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_231.wav|63|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_263.wav|29|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_401.wav|13|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_482.wav|24|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_328.wav|33|It's my initial background.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_039.wav|73|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_092.wav|94|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_206.wav|100|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_376.wav|54|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_129.wav|13|He is adamant that he is innocent.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_212.wav|4|But who will buy it?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_240.wav|95|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_101.wav|46|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_022.wav|66|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_108.wav|33|The driver was unhurt.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_100.wav|62|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_010.wav|98|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_052.wav|94|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_263.wav|34|It is having a big impact.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_090.wav|72|They've got their own agenda.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_314.wav|76|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_177.wav|45|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_027.wav|103|It's not a solo.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_338.wav|32|It is a court case.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_169.wav|82|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_385.wav|20|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_131.wav|20|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_298.wav|1|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_169.wav|46|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_170.wav|53|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_331.wav|76|Everyone's too upset to comment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_031.wav|21|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_311.wav|28|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_280.wav|48|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_402.wav|100|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_379.wav|53|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_198.wav|43|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_118.wav|24|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_235.wav|72|But there is a possible place.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_005.wav|69|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_220.wav|6|Ours is on for two days.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_167.wav|17|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_183.wav|1|Euro The single currency is a fact.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_280.wav|25|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_137.wav|104|It was different in the endurance events.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_255.wav|18|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_075.wav|71|"It is a job creation scheme."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_200.wav|88|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_152.wav|104|It's a wonderful piece of water.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_199.wav|61|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_152.wav|62|I only wanted to give her a fright.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_347.wav|43|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_336.wav|105|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_033.wav|1|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_044.wav|70|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_404.wav|37|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_294.wav|15|All is now forgiven.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_222.wav|20|I will win.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_197.wav|26|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_187.wav|23|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_124.wav|16|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_187.wav|3|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_037.wav|75|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_291.wav|5|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_189.wav|86|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_109.wav|73|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_204.wav|45|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_191.wav|80|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_129.wav|21|If so, they were wrong.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_052.wav|77|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_340.wav|49|I'm the one who has to suffer.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_218.wav|8|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_226.wav|7|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_455.wav|7|Nobody has told the story.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_309.wav|12|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_126.wav|103|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_106.wav|97|We have got the school holidays on.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_298.wav|35|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_415.wav|24|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_207.wav|65|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_193.wav|44|It was not a foul.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_196.wav|28|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_300.wav|50|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_026.wav|33|I don't think they can complain about that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_032.wav|12|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_321.wav|92|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_356.wav|105|He knew his job inside out.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_253.wav|67|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_337.wav|19|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_341.wav|31|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_093.wav|12|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_219.wav|24|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_295.wav|98|Even then it might be difficult.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_049.wav|53|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_228.wav|58|This must be really short of ideas.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_125.wav|20|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_168.wav|77|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_394.wav|37|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_291.wav|89|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_099.wav|103|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_214.wav|34|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_274.wav|57|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_294.wav|94|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_356.wav|77|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_020.wav|64|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_308.wav|46|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_302.wav|8|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_268.wav|34|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_003.wav|14|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_413.wav|26|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_298.wav|104|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_157.wav|65|Now it was Britain's turn.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_195.wav|54|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_137.wav|0|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_292.wav|88|I was the willing journeyman.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_247.wav|40|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_306.wav|99|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_270.wav|61|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_054.wav|54|We see little sign of improvement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_211.wav|26|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_161.wav|8|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_402.wav|52|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_392.wav|26|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_337.wav|40|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_362.wav|15|The same goes for Russia.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_416.wav|39|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_060.wav|42|The tribunal continues today.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_353.wav|1|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_118.wav|18|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_009.wav|101|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_100.wav|60|I have never considered it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_383.wav|29|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_304.wav|19|I am not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_132.wav|52|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_278.wav|0|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_282.wav|66|I have been totally taken aback by this.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_147.wav|33|It was a discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_246.wav|29|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_355.wav|49|There is access for disabled people.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_210.wav|83|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_352.wav|49|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_170.wav|84|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_217.wav|95|I will work on her.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_178.wav|66|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_004.wav|103|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_273.wav|67|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_357.wav|34|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_239.wav|42|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_178.wav|52|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_116.wav|99|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_046.wav|24|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_164.wav|35|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_183.wav|73|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_009.wav|36|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_112.wav|51|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_156.wav|51|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_013.wav|21|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_351.wav|96|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_310.wav|43|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_231.wav|73|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_341.wav|102|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_373.wav|6|Only two things are certain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_094.wav|14|They lived for their children.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_425.wav|37|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_347.wav|94|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_266.wav|98|The kids are paying the price.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_008.wav|22|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_057.wav|71|"Sadly, it can't."
DUMMY2/p279/p279_143.wav|25|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_340.wav|28|Self control is just one instalment.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_200.wav|70|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_154.wav|55|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_005.wav|54|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_053.wav|44|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_136.wav|28|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_435.wav|100|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_105.wav|100|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_346.wav|66|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_057.wav|104|I am not here to get even.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_329.wav|44|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_079.wav|80|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_303.wav|29|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_393.wav|18|It is good football in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_183.wav|40|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_099.wav|48|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_184.wav|16|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_094.wav|9|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_263.wav|14|He has also cut a record.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_090.wav|56|It's not a holiday time for football players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_009.wav|56|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_290.wav|54|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_232.wav|58|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_366.wav|99|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_276.wav|92|Manchester United are the classic example.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_262.wav|85|What are you waiting for?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_354.wav|39|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_012.wav|32|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p313/p313_158.wav|76|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_246.wav|62|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_063.wav|43|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_106.wav|86|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_170.wav|89|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_302.wav|21|There is no point of looking any further.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_189.wav|26|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_251.wav|16|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_102.wav|77|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_062.wav|35|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_020.wav|74|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_221.wav|32|The red card was okay.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_342.wav|83|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_103.wav|102|Housing is in very short supply.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_112.wav|104|My ambition is to tell a good story.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_156.wav|8|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_305.wav|52|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_095.wav|78|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_260.wav|80|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_071.wav|61|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_113.wav|84|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_220.wav|91|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_128.wav|106|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_288.wav|22|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_139.wav|28|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_334.wav|41|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_191.wav|26|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_380.wav|22|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_226.wav|69|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_132.wav|81|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_048.wav|94|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_166.wav|97|That is a lot of writing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_174.wav|23|The people here are quite reserved.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_107.wav|1|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_305.wav|84|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_032.wav|82|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_302.wav|2|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_339.wav|63|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_213.wav|42|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_346.wav|45|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_278.wav|84|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_432.wav|32|The trial will open today.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_395.wav|25|So I did.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_270.wav|15|We are moving on.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_086.wav|4|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_286.wav|67|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_012.wav|70|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_101.wav|19|This is my personal assessment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_262.wav|56|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_127.wav|43|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_137.wav|82|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_361.wav|89|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_080.wav|0|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_234.wav|11|They want it to work.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_057.wav|103|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_307.wav|0|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_102.wav|105|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_026.wav|106|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_119.wav|48|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_079.wav|58|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_294.wav|36|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_010.wav|78|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_203.wav|66|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_270.wav|68|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_004.wav|88|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_112.wav|37|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_150.wav|104|It's a great idea.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_355.wav|48|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_244.wav|18|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_277.wav|4|There's a lot of hysteria.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_414.wav|56|I would like to continue to develop.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_402.wav|26|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_241.wav|46|Altman has every right to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_015.wav|51|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_087.wav|54|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_097.wav|94|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_031.wav|77|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_171.wav|95|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_213.wav|37|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_006.wav|42|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_032.wav|14|It is not for any other purpose.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_270.wav|66|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_021.wav|32|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p294/p294_394.wav|104|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_244.wav|2|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_149.wav|105|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_096.wav|90|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_290.wav|29|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_316.wav|42|But there was no time for that.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_005.wav|11|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_208.wav|61|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_124.wav|82|It is sad and frustrating.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_042.wav|76|That, though, was just the start of it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_374.wav|82|This is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_147.wav|99|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_467.wav|63|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_021.wav|88|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_406.wav|37|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_398.wav|52|People have a wish to charge twice.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_110.wav|63|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_176.wav|15|Only two players have done it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_196.wav|16|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_038.wav|59|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_310.wav|34|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_084.wav|42|It was the crowning point of my career.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_135.wav|6|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_352.wav|57|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_011.wav|81|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_004.wav|93|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_285.wav|105|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_225.wav|69|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_133.wav|74|I certainly would not accept this decision.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_122.wav|20|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_202.wav|63|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_018.wav|60|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_192.wav|82|Tonight's matches European Championship.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_345.wav|67|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_099.wav|12|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_213.wav|10|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_300.wav|12|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_245.wav|79|That has to take its toll.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_284.wav|18|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_124.wav|52|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_056.wav|14|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_178.wav|100|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_341.wav|49|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_013.wav|43|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_120.wav|61|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_022.wav|16|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_073.wav|36|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_039.wav|105|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_335.wav|12|I believe he can do a better job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_304.wav|43|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_171.wav|13|It's a technical demand.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_439.wav|39|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_474.wav|48|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_267.wav|53|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_237.wav|42|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_051.wav|74|This has been a difficult time for me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_227.wav|21|The service will only survive with change.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_058.wav|17|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_306.wav|58|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_380.wav|48|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_065.wav|27|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_070.wav|105|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_234.wav|70|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_028.wav|31|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_099.wav|62|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_062.wav|99|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_429.wav|37|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_311.wav|77|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_173.wav|20|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_357.wav|1|They might want to play.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_324.wav|70|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_184.wav|10|It is vital to clarify their role.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_338.wav|59|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_359.wav|82|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_075.wav|59|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_222.wav|79|It is the best place.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_202.wav|37|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_096.wav|100|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p244/p244_270.wav|78|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_263.wav|99|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_083.wav|41|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_314.wav|72|It is too early to say.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_096.wav|64|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_340.wav|72|They should be looking at his victims.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_169.wav|90|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_209.wav|33|It's a very important and beautiful day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_302.wav|25|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_315.wav|106|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_030.wav|102|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_352.wav|103|It is a decision which has paid off.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_202.wav|103|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_040.wav|71|"It was clear."
DUMMY2/p316/p316_382.wav|85|You do need a check and a balance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_055.wav|57|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_294.wav|98|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_200.wav|74|This is your life.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_266.wav|66|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_210.wav|4|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_084.wav|78|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_238.wav|65|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_419.wav|107|It was another good idea.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_211.wav|95|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_014.wav|7|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_258.wav|15|So, how did you do?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_197.wav|39|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_360.wav|83|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_002.wav|12|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_013.wav|6|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_199.wav|72|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_130.wav|97|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_136.wav|62|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_168.wav|80|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_198.wav|54|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_003.wav|93|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_138.wav|8|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_261.wav|95|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_144.wav|37|All the employees are redundant.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_127.wav|80|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_167.wav|6|But that was his nature.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_313.wav|75|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_397.wav|50|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_400.wav|58|We are working on the two things.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_206.wav|49|The text is reduced to bubbles.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_370.wav|53|I have come here to show support for the families.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_256.wav|53|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_376.wav|4|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_027.wav|107|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_237.wav|39|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_147.wav|105|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_135.wav|5|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_328.wav|67|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_041.wav|60|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_374.wav|29|It has been made to entertain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_313.wav|27|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_033.wav|91|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_025.wav|81|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_177.wav|2|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_016.wav|76|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_131.wav|36|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_136.wav|19|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_283.wav|43|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_342.wav|105|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_395.wav|87|It is sending the wrong message to people.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_249.wav|40|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_381.wav|21|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_054.wav|47|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_357.wav|9|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_209.wav|25|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_209.wav|84|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_074.wav|8|It is not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_111.wav|97|This is the big one.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_264.wav|33|No other country has ever won this tournament.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_390.wav|27|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_111.wav|28|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_174.wav|15|I was a little surprised.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_150.wav|85|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_295.wav|12|People will make up their own minds.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_334.wav|93|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_342.wav|33|I am proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_069.wav|93|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_039.wav|65|I wish I could see it again.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_197.wav|1|Billie was yet to be born.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_361.wav|97|We want to replicate that success.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_083.wav|18|Or have they?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_163.wav|55|Mr Dewar understood that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_155.wav|20|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_355.wav|63|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_327.wav|36|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_293.wav|33|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_396.wav|52|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_309.wav|39|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_276.wav|12|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_229.wav|56|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_317.wav|86|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_134.wav|32|This is a major championship.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_345.wav|57|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_164.wav|53|Surely it can't run for two years.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_286.wav|88|She died later on Monday.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_029.wav|23|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_295.wav|100|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_120.wav|78|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_450.wav|37|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_080.wav|45|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_248.wav|58|It was a tactical change.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_062.wav|48|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_311.wav|37|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_151.wav|70|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_415.wav|7|Theatre is not a museum.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_281.wav|29|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_046.wav|79|The answer was wrong.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_201.wav|20|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_428.wav|56|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_067.wav|71|"We should have known."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_174.wav|100|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_018.wav|101|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_098.wav|33|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_309.wav|11|This is as bad as it can get.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_093.wav|3|He is in the US.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_057.wav|20|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_175.wav|44|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_173.wav|107|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_203.wav|0|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_130.wav|10|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_166.wav|92|He is willing to pay the required amount.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_301.wav|84|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_229.wav|99|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_243.wav|84|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_380.wav|58|Do what you have to do.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_443.wav|48|They should not feel under threat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_187.wav|102|All were paid by the taxpayer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_421.wav|11|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_165.wav|77|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_398.wav|38|I'm sure they love it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_307.wav|56|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_206.wav|89|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_267.wav|52|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_046.wav|86|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_120.wav|81|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_411.wav|106|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_144.wav|0|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_100.wav|47|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_386.wav|22|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_423.wav|60|It's unfair on her.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_148.wav|70|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_397.wav|20|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_179.wav|79|They get money for it now.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_134.wav|38|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_320.wav|51|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_267.wav|99|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_232.wav|6|The legal process could last weeks.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_383.wav|2|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_045.wav|60|This will take up to nine months.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_019.wav|32|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_032.wav|31|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_273.wav|18|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_014.wav|96|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_175.wav|77|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_222.wav|74|We have no further comment to make.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_131.wav|61|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_184.wav|58|Our members are concerned about their futures.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_196.wav|82|Business has never been so bad.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_171.wav|41|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_109.wav|19|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_319.wav|57|Is that an issue ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_191.wav|98|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_249.wav|64|He's in with the furniture.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_235.wav|60|I think he was lost for words.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_042.wav|17|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_151.wav|14|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_344.wav|76|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_083.wav|94|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_076.wav|86|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_152.wav|37|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_165.wav|92|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_119.wav|90|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_011.wav|101|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_193.wav|48|In addition, margins have been maintained.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_295.wav|68|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_006.wav|39|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_083.wav|83|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_026.wav|17|I fell in love with the ballet.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_148.wav|55|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_142.wav|10|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_075.wav|75|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_223.wav|45|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_135.wav|22|How good is Lennox Lewis?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_330.wav|59|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_042.wav|43|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_313.wav|24|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_097.wav|74|You will never get a conviction.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_338.wav|68|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_238.wav|51|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_028.wav|19|I intend to raise the matter there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_111.wav|18|I always liked to get a laugh.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_033.wav|7|We speak about the performance.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_391.wav|0|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_065.wav|12|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_025.wav|39|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_269.wav|86|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_077.wav|94|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_269.wav|26|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_073.wav|5|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_273.wav|42|I will not walk away from this job.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_203.wav|50|What are you no good at ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_158.wav|21|It is a traffic warden.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_371.wav|52|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_118.wav|58|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_272.wav|10|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_205.wav|54|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_208.wav|21|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_371.wav|35|My goal is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_189.wav|69|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_065.wav|38|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_299.wav|59|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_031.wav|57|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_041.wav|30|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_254.wav|35|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_277.wav|53|I think the shares are good value.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_018.wav|103|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_308.wav|4|The director's a genius.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_268.wav|82|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_137.wav|86|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_202.wav|3|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_211.wav|65|He was a home referee.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_164.wav|90|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_315.wav|32|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_424.wav|64|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_120.wav|67|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_068.wav|48|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_043.wav|71|"We need to chat."
DUMMY2/p330/p330_008.wav|1|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_219.wav|41|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_398.wav|62|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_240.wav|58|I would say so.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_044.wav|92|It is just like any other club.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_224.wav|36|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_384.wav|39|It was like a weekly wage.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_163.wav|47|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_168.wav|89|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_212.wav|73|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_100.wav|13|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_251.wav|99|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_428.wav|40|And they replied.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_363.wav|104|It is also used to buy coffins.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_263.wav|107|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_105.wav|64|That's why he visited.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_011.wav|29|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_145.wav|37|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_088.wav|57|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_275.wav|52|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_032.wav|44|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_192.wav|32|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_014.wav|78|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_146.wav|67|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_045.wav|35|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_240.wav|70|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_030.wav|86|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_097.wav|21|What was this?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_442.wav|27|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_066.wav|21|This happened on three days inside a week.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_395.wav|41|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_431.wav|27|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_201.wav|9|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_188.wav|39|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_029.wav|76|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_251.wav|93|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_146.wav|2|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_054.wav|100|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_179.wav|95|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_214.wav|0|They're going to open in early summer.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_215.wav|27|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_058.wav|27|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_226.wav|61|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_269.wav|82|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_312.wav|78|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_072.wav|58|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_018.wav|93|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_031.wav|27|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_361.wav|49|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_399.wav|60|These were the edited highlights.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_201.wav|64|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_341.wav|50|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_366.wav|22|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_279.wav|52|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_273.wav|60|He is completely committed to us.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_347.wav|23|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_464.wav|32|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_297.wav|73|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_360.wav|22|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_064.wav|28|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_083.wav|45|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_297.wav|38|We have been extremely lucky this time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_308.wav|11|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_220.wav|4|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_072.wav|24|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_302.wav|37|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_344.wav|39|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_137.wav|52|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_108.wav|91|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_261.wav|76|He was in contention almost every week.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_032.wav|68|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_244.wav|80|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_252.wav|68|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_181.wav|82|We don't know what happened.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_280.wav|22|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_196.wav|2|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_112.wav|105|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_235.wav|11|For once it wasn't about money.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_397.wav|66|It was a sell-out.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_315.wav|35|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_166.wav|36|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_080.wav|36|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_348.wav|36|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_288.wav|62|That was the initial attraction.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_285.wav|35|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_311.wav|59|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_226.wav|105|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_440.wav|63|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_054.wav|107|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_019.wav|15|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_420.wav|48|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_106.wav|24|We have made no final decisions.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_065.wav|56|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_127.wav|103|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_160.wav|33|They might also be parlous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_401.wav|18|She was on the edge of breaking point.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_394.wav|51|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_284.wav|14|These figures are truly terrible.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_145.wav|100|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_304.wav|16|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_266.wav|15|He's a great dealer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_216.wav|20|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_307.wav|19|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_130.wav|91|We need to move forward together.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_119.wav|25|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_395.wav|29|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_322.wav|64|This is my music.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_024.wav|38|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_092.wav|79|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_045.wav|48|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_139.wav|95|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_359.wav|102|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_172.wav|14|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_040.wav|53|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_375.wav|72|Only the details have to be sorted out.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_107.wav|28|It's a metaphor for consumption.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_187.wav|54|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_235.wav|27|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_063.wav|6|There wasn't anything in it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_098.wav|8|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_229.wav|22|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_026.wav|0|He may not need to force that message.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_158.wav|88|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_202.wav|74|He can be beaten.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_306.wav|54|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_127.wav|59|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_319.wav|33|They were not up to the required standard.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_020.wav|29|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_210.wav|67|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_452.wav|39|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_196.wav|23|We will only move forward.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_106.wav|84|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_243.wav|70|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_043.wav|79|So, we have to go back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_377.wav|11|Everyone here is very sad.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_322.wav|55|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_081.wav|48|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_073.wav|24|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_214.wav|24|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_287.wav|97|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_008.wav|100|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_234.wav|61|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_103.wav|75|It's not a lack of effort.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_291.wav|68|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_236.wav|43|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_240.wav|6|I think we can do well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_195.wav|60|I'm not going to blame the band.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_240.wav|75|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_041.wav|4|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_393.wav|62|We had no choice but to go down.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_211.wav|83|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_336.wav|6|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_100.wav|74|Or did it?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_040.wav|38|I wanted to win so badly.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_235.wav|43|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_007.wav|24|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_219.wav|40|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_012.wav|96|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_065.wav|88|It's not going to work.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_011.wav|14|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p302/p302_193.wav|30|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_195.wav|27|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_243.wav|13|They might well be right.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_200.wav|50|Libya is an easy target.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_018.wav|28|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_064.wav|74|That, however, was the exception.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_017.wav|75|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_067.wav|87|I would not say that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_164.wav|62|His first album was a hit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_169.wav|99|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_039.wav|31|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_003.wav|75|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_390.wav|20|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_035.wav|91|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_329.wav|13|But everywhere the problems are the same.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_330.wav|18|We have expected it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_187.wav|38|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_187.wav|72|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_015.wav|19|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_274.wav|3|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_049.wav|85|So, why does he do it?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_061.wav|12|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_290.wav|27|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_078.wav|15|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_138.wav|34|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_364.wav|28|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_194.wav|70|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_220.wav|25|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_495.wav|65|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_222.wav|80|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_133.wav|45|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_318.wav|37|Sadly, it does not end there.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_234.wav|25|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_091.wav|72|This commitment should be built upon.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_392.wav|87|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_176.wav|78|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_176.wav|1|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_088.wav|44|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_290.wav|62|He's also thinking long-term.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_088.wav|80|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_238.wav|57|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_280.wav|96|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_378.wav|94|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_038.wav|6|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_304.wav|24|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_258.wav|73|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_047.wav|11|I am inclined to play it down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_400.wav|19|His primary residence is Scotland.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_312.wav|28|The other conditions were not specified.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_198.wav|42|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_203.wav|101|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_365.wav|98|There was too much at stake.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_342.wav|63|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_096.wav|45|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_291.wav|103|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_126.wav|25|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_070.wav|85|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_168.wav|37|They almost achieved a draw.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_414.wav|46|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_076.wav|64|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_041.wav|59|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_169.wav|72|He asked me how they were doing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_326.wav|100|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_111.wav|41|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_080.wav|27|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_282.wav|107|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_272.wav|2|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_248.wav|12|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_382.wav|105|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_155.wav|28|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_200.wav|46|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_003.wav|46|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_433.wav|105|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_102.wav|52|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_394.wav|7|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_325.wav|104|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_158.wav|64|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_152.wav|79|This series is for real.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_295.wav|75|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_387.wav|65|Young people will always run away.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_353.wav|26|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_132.wav|6|There was something special about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_265.wav|97|Whatever happened to that one?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_046.wav|92|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_330.wav|8|This isn't the end of story.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_143.wav|107|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_014.wav|50|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_004.wav|101|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_184.wav|88|So it was in politics.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_122.wav|2|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_010.wav|32|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_364.wav|25|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_281.wav|46|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_051.wav|81|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_393.wav|37|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_215.wav|32|I am considered a teenager.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_103.wav|19|Although, you never know.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_463.wav|106|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_165.wav|43|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_230.wav|52|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_008.wav|6|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_283.wav|70|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_136.wav|63|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_341.wav|26|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_044.wav|53|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_335.wav|79|It is our other home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_331.wav|12|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_369.wav|92|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_307.wav|8|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_302.wav|70|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_423.wav|17|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_236.wav|98|It was just above the roof.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_148.wav|107|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_279.wav|87|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_384.wav|22|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_209.wav|32|We have an election in eight days.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_168.wav|41|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_218.wav|59|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_274.wav|46|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_062.wav|96|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_093.wav|75|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_123.wav|1|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_262.wav|73|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_070.wav|28|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_193.wav|63|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_284.wav|81|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_126.wav|77|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_318.wav|61|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_213.wav|64|Police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_036.wav|18|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_164.wav|6|I have been very stupid.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_453.wav|65|They finished second and third.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_218.wav|104|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_151.wav|57|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_223.wav|82|Must have been at the bar.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_176.wav|94|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_263.wav|36|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_403.wav|69|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_332.wav|72|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_201.wav|103|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_270.wav|22|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_023.wav|51|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_282.wav|61|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_092.wav|9|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_194.wav|95|It was to be inclusive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_201.wav|51|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_087.wav|33|Things are meant to be.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_204.wav|81|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_401.wav|76|I found that much more challenging.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_118.wav|11|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_299.wav|22|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_251.wav|73|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_185.wav|41|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_029.wav|22|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_403.wav|4|The men are safe and unharmed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_346.wav|85|Italy would be lukewarm.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_250.wav|58|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_151.wav|67|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_228.wav|89|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_304.wav|81|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_011.wav|0|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_169.wav|36|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_280.wav|103|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_289.wav|47|So I did.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_492.wav|75|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_137.wav|26|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_242.wav|87|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_047.wav|87|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_105.wav|49|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_205.wav|38|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_272.wav|51|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_108.wav|87|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_054.wav|25|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_104.wav|49|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_410.wav|16|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_178.wav|36|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_350.wav|107|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_025.wav|52|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_324.wav|75|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_403.wav|48|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_007.wav|57|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_356.wav|104|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_250.wav|7|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_375.wav|58|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_421.wav|77|That's been all around Europe with me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_224.wav|12|There is nothing like this back home.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_103.wav|33|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_261.wav|99|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_195.wav|57|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_206.wav|66|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_004.wav|15|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_058.wav|41|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_376.wav|94|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_034.wav|98|We had a really good experience with David.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_364.wav|105|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_340.wav|96|Who will do it ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_064.wav|85|This is a dream come true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_396.wav|102|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_285.wav|1|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_169.wav|80|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_085.wav|33|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_045.wav|65|We're working on it night and day.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_047.wav|51|I only half believe it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_137.wav|73|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_410.wav|74|Once again, he refused.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_324.wav|56|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_189.wav|44|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_388.wav|89|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_256.wav|10|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_316.wav|85|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_307.wav|4|That is when we are really effective.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_085.wav|38|They use them for everything.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_013.wav|38|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_351.wav|34|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_270.wav|83|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_038.wav|28|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_205.wav|35|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_259.wav|107|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_326.wav|32|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_399.wav|82|It was still there last night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_112.wav|12|There is great relief at this point.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_018.wav|83|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_133.wav|15|Labour is providing none of these.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_408.wav|87|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_008.wav|85|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_105.wav|66|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_252.wav|92|What kind of festival is proposed?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_107.wav|56|There's still plenty of time left.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_073.wav|21|I am ready to go.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_202.wav|0|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_110.wav|28|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_029.wav|18|What is a house without it?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_204.wav|88|It requires a wider team.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_236.wav|51|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_334.wav|57|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_349.wav|99|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_349.wav|76|It's been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_382.wav|41|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_424.wav|39|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_157.wav|22|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_014.wav|15|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_215.wav|44|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_043.wav|96|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_107.wav|17|Or, rather, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_091.wav|21|It's terrible that this is happening.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_118.wav|105|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_059.wav|59|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_139.wav|17|The starting point is pretty unusual.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_164.wav|16|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_061.wav|11|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_312.wav|77|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_097.wav|44|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_234.wav|30|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_114.wav|65|But they had to be paid for.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_351.wav|69|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_179.wav|10|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_035.wav|4|With actors it is slightly different.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_312.wav|15|It is good football in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_422.wav|106|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_266.wav|61|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_337.wav|5|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_272.wav|92|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_017.wav|85|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_365.wav|23|He doesn't even know who he is.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_349.wav|105|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_418.wav|97|She was extremely rigid.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_236.wav|105|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_366.wav|15|We were getting very worried.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_071.wav|92|We would have looked out for each other.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_331.wav|27|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_187.wav|59|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_215.wav|106|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_397.wav|29|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_122.wav|58|They married in August last year.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_172.wav|23|Family members are at her bedside.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_172.wav|95|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_143.wav|31|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_066.wav|3|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_131.wav|29|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_189.wav|104|The First Minister is an addict.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_325.wav|105|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_028.wav|20|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_316.wav|61|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_372.wav|10|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_065.wav|22|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_284.wav|36|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_036.wav|34|It is misleading to compare the two.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_167.wav|62|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_173.wav|6|There are two characters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_369.wav|42|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_171.wav|101|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_081.wav|75|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_047.wav|8|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_311.wav|7|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_370.wav|79|They haven't got the uniform.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_115.wav|79|This could easily have been another tragedy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_092.wav|105|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_224.wav|78|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_045.wav|72|I was doing a charity concert.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_096.wav|82|You can't go on forever.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_347.wav|52|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_313.wav|97|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_156.wav|85|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_379.wav|14|The group is not paying a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_170.wav|37|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_204.wav|76|Election results are expected soon.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_050.wav|11|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_408.wav|13|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_362.wav|96|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_286.wav|82|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_326.wav|19|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_283.wav|91|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_008.wav|71|"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "
DUMMY2/p303/p303_202.wav|44|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_330.wav|26|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_256.wav|48|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_428.wav|27|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_229.wav|38|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_069.wav|66|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_306.wav|5|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_197.wav|106|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_052.wav|31|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_306.wav|89|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_095.wav|51|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_206.wav|73|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_227.wav|106|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_249.wav|106|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_309.wav|62|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_018.wav|53|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_346.wav|17|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_358.wav|62|It's just so sad.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_040.wav|68|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_279.wav|102|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_268.wav|97|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_121.wav|20|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_416.wav|92|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_245.wav|43|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_068.wav|76|However, there is great potential in this right.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_328.wav|9|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_179.wav|102|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_401.wav|4|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_392.wav|32|He has earned the right to their respect.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_038.wav|85|What a week he has had.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_115.wav|4|Otherwise we will pay the price.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_293.wav|85|It is planned for London in the spring.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_065.wav|39|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_274.wav|59|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_301.wav|54|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_343.wav|40|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_317.wav|96|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_053.wav|0|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_011.wav|23|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_022.wav|94|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_234.wav|23|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_176.wav|72|The result today is an impasse.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_244.wav|64|Altman has every right to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_244.wav|10|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_023.wav|57|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_035.wav|80|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_065.wav|93|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_122.wav|21|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_289.wav|7|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_111.wav|8|The website has changed the company.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_125.wav|24|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_407.wav|0|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_256.wav|105|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_282.wav|9|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_259.wav|97|We have great confidence in Derek.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_050.wav|72|His father said, My son was lucky.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_302.wav|44|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_423.wav|49|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_007.wav|12|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_131.wav|74|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_212.wav|69|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_293.wav|66|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_124.wav|20|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_132.wav|60|I knew that we needed to get out.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_299.wav|60|Why have you decided to get married?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_429.wav|39|It is that sort of film.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_290.wav|70|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_447.wav|27|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_179.wav|5|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_385.wav|89|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_043.wav|64|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_014.wav|14|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p243/p243_098.wav|53|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_363.wav|87|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_310.wav|64|That was him under pressure.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_294.wav|99|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_035.wav|94|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_217.wav|58|He made so many bad decisions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_239.wav|12|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_369.wav|39|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_141.wav|29|He's not a Celtic man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_273.wav|55|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_196.wav|60|I think that he got the message.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_317.wav|78|We want to get back into the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_024.wav|103|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_358.wav|78|The challenge is to win a cup.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_150.wav|86|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_365.wav|57|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_394.wav|74|It's good to be back.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_279.wav|73|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_268.wav|28|We're very pleased about the verdict.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_148.wav|97|It was a wilful act of violence.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_352.wav|58|I have not been so angry for years.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_313.wav|79|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_115.wav|98|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_206.wav|61|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_124.wav|13|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_208.wav|101|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_231.wav|0|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_282.wav|13|That was the gimmick.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_034.wav|17|He didn't really, we just made that up.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_078.wav|36|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_082.wav|5|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_097.wav|33|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_124.wav|72|But he admits he is deeply upset.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_324.wav|62|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_034.wav|64|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_326.wav|89|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_068.wav|33|That just wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_268.wav|19|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_275.wav|63|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_195.wav|53|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_258.wav|63|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_284.wav|45|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_223.wav|32|Laura is an investment banker.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_415.wav|19|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_244.wav|43|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_295.wav|61|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_021.wav|92|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_027.wav|101|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_295.wav|83|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_130.wav|45|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_254.wav|50|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_279.wav|64|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_233.wav|13|Anyone else can apply.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_053.wav|62|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_023.wav|85|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_237.wav|76|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_039.wav|26|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_327.wav|104|Is that what people we want?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_020.wav|56|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_053.wav|91|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_207.wav|61|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_068.wav|12|How things have changed since then.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_145.wav|32|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_076.wav|9|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_056.wav|15|This was no accident.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_074.wav|97|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_285.wav|96|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_360.wav|11|One person had a broken back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_134.wav|1|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_319.wav|42|The company's in good shape.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_178.wav|8|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_284.wav|86|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_105.wav|69|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_206.wav|93|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_066.wav|72|First is open defiance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_061.wav|15|And there has been a good start.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_151.wav|5|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_283.wav|58|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_354.wav|33|The Government has listened.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_134.wav|77|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_155.wav|29|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_237.wav|90|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_264.wav|59|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_184.wav|26|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_375.wav|98|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_305.wav|3|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_168.wav|35|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_420.wav|56|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_429.wav|24|That was the agreement with the manager.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_181.wav|54|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_213.wav|79|The response was really good.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_123.wav|101|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_191.wav|30|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_149.wav|72|So what makes it so special?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_393.wav|60|I am in a very difficult position.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_083.wav|67|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p361/p361_302.wav|79|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_122.wav|65|That was a great performance by the team.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_030.wav|31|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_021.wav|16|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_406.wav|98|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_374.wav|42|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_371.wav|2|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_004.wav|67|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_026.wav|83|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_224.wav|60|It just never comes together.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_273.wav|90|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_118.wav|34|If it does it means he has failed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_105.wav|77|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_125.wav|3|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_267.wav|103|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_419.wav|37|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_350.wav|50|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_204.wav|86|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_132.wav|86|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_389.wav|60|No, they are not the same thing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_098.wav|3|I cannot wait to get started on it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_216.wav|95|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_010.wav|89|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_218.wav|44|We didn't know if people would turn up.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_067.wav|101|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_333.wav|32|The group is not paying a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_361.wav|70|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_469.wav|48|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_366.wav|101|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_264.wav|104|It possibly depends on the position.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_242.wav|18|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_045.wav|85|After that it is up to the boss.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_237.wav|103|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_008.wav|104|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_334.wav|63|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_008.wav|82|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_407.wav|36|It was the same expression of joy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_242.wav|51|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_282.wav|18|No other family members could be contacted.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_327.wav|87|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_362.wav|53|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_049.wav|18|I don't think that he won't be released.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_315.wav|80|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_160.wav|22|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_343.wav|50|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_297.wav|31|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_216.wav|11|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_304.wav|11|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_277.wav|59|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_117.wav|26|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_217.wav|93|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_215.wav|47|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_340.wav|45|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_275.wav|7|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_059.wav|14|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_272.wav|43|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_363.wav|45|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_398.wav|1|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_390.wav|66|Then came the second round.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_266.wav|85|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_218.wav|65|Life is still very tough for them.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_072.wav|16|It was magic.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_099.wav|65|What are you not good at?)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_369.wav|19|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_094.wav|4|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_283.wav|84|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_342.wav|40|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_204.wav|82|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_076.wav|1|I want to help other women.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_389.wav|82|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_189.wav|51|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_114.wav|63|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_024.wav|60|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_401.wav|97|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_032.wav|72|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_038.wav|42|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_357.wav|104|He completely loses control.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_026.wav|90|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_246.wav|10|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p311/p311_406.wav|4|I was frustrated here.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_380.wav|70|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_348.wav|59|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_189.wav|19|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_218.wav|22|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_168.wav|3|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_199.wav|51|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_306.wav|79|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_099.wav|18|What you sow, you have to reap.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_178.wav|96|It's the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_328.wav|85|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_092.wav|15|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_123.wav|48|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_024.wav|35|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_003.wav|45|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_114.wav|71|"It is a delight on every level."
DUMMY2/p243/p243_272.wav|53|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_398.wav|21|There is no formula.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_078.wav|80|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_249.wav|80|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_360.wav|0|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_326.wav|42|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_420.wav|17|I think it's a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_190.wav|34|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_201.wav|45|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_205.wav|91|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_027.wav|39|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_392.wav|23|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_264.wav|93|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_097.wav|98|This is in a league of its own.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_351.wav|100|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_356.wav|107|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_173.wav|25|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_160.wav|105|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_390.wav|56|Rugby is a hard game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_074.wav|103|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_124.wav|60|So many people will be affected by this.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_179.wav|20|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_318.wav|106|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_318.wav|104|Now they have found out the truth.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_130.wav|4|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_221.wav|19|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_323.wav|56|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_274.wav|61|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_356.wav|45|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_307.wav|90|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_116.wav|75|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_119.wav|45|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_303.wav|49|This looks like it is anything but open.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_241.wav|82|I can't describe it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_078.wav|98|I get the bus.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_190.wav|46|Glasgow then took control.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_217.wav|24|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p247/p247_150.wav|14|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_125.wav|62|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_150.wav|63|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_046.wav|19|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_364.wav|106|He worked there for six months.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_298.wav|41|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_420.wav|95|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_304.wav|0|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_002.wav|84|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_187.wav|22|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_200.wav|13|Drugs are always an issue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_478.wav|24|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_144.wav|9|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_263.wav|96|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_141.wav|95|But it is different in different regions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_338.wav|36|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_245.wav|61|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_133.wav|61|Who will attend ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_423.wav|75|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_328.wav|44|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_056.wav|87|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_077.wav|96|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_124.wav|50|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_060.wav|107|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_389.wav|19|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_085.wav|7|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_084.wav|15|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_286.wav|86|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_086.wav|64|That is in the public domain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_018.wav|89|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_173.wav|35|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_275.wav|58|The things writers and directors say!
DUMMY2/p304/p304_177.wav|72|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_325.wav|37|Their conclusions were never published.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_239.wav|19|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_339.wav|20|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_063.wav|40|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_002.wav|33|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_293.wav|23|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_179.wav|59|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_234.wav|105|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_247.wav|61|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_183.wav|104|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_150.wav|65|Did he trip?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_322.wav|53|We will not simply hit these people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_040.wav|102|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_122.wav|90|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_240.wav|56|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_043.wav|69|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_299.wav|28|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_197.wav|93|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_192.wav|28|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_283.wav|54|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_141.wav|59|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_345.wav|96|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_362.wav|97|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_339.wav|65|Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_353.wav|85|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_090.wav|84|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_356.wav|52|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_342.wav|10|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_126.wav|5|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_236.wav|36|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_160.wav|91|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_218.wav|61|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_023.wav|33|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_043.wav|24|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_324.wav|37|Celtic were the losers then.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_045.wav|2|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_189.wav|59|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_422.wav|16|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_152.wav|8|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_060.wav|105|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_396.wav|19|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_393.wav|107|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_065.wav|24|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_061.wav|103|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_388.wav|42|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_325.wav|54|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_335.wav|68|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_129.wav|47|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_331.wav|93|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_266.wav|63|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_188.wav|46|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_092.wav|73|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_338.wav|54|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_324.wav|39|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_017.wav|36|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_145.wav|47|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_333.wav|15|It's not going to last five minutes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_159.wav|22|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_005.wav|33|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_379.wav|97|It's a hidden problem.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_239.wav|99|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_013.wav|97|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_249.wav|52|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_088.wav|96|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_190.wav|9|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_336.wav|43|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_205.wav|106|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_044.wav|6|It is the strength of the school.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_098.wav|42|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_342.wav|92|I believe in public services.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_388.wav|50|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_415.wav|72|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_183.wav|89|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_305.wav|104|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_065.wav|62|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_330.wav|45|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_310.wav|8|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_242.wav|76|I tried to push him away.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_048.wav|5|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_404.wav|17|We were close, but not close enough.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_209.wav|98|The claim was denied by the first minister.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_316.wav|65|This is extremely positive news.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_036.wav|78|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_227.wav|60|So it was at Easter Road.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_379.wav|84|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_200.wav|99|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_419.wav|75|They were not complacent in any way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_083.wav|66|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_172.wav|67|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_088.wav|4|I have hardly any commitments.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_189.wav|28|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_149.wav|82|That's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_286.wav|17|Is he any good in the kitchen?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_211.wav|45|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_074.wav|9|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_159.wav|45|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_147.wav|20|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_153.wav|44|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_203.wav|49|That is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_221.wav|34|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_237.wav|43|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_088.wav|103|He just wants to play.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_393.wav|68|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_373.wav|50|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_125.wav|71|"Well, you can have a tree."
DUMMY2/p247/p247_413.wav|14|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_311.wav|53|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_329.wav|61|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_142.wav|68|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_367.wav|28|We're not travel agents.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_390.wav|28|Wrong decisions Address in full
DUMMY2/p276/p276_303.wav|106|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_162.wav|4|But no, it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_076.wav|13|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_357.wav|64|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_388.wav|4|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_221.wav|5|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_314.wav|32|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_175.wav|21|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_319.wav|27|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_160.wav|18|He would have done the same to me.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_222.wav|18|We will all suffer as a result.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_141.wav|24|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_109.wav|2|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_436.wav|32|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_137.wav|24|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_073.wav|49|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_182.wav|19|From now on there is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_061.wav|76|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_371.wav|77|We knew he was very creative.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_322.wav|105|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_318.wav|103|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_344.wav|84|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_139.wav|12|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_158.wav|50|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_270.wav|30|The outstanding issues are still there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_357.wav|47|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_339.wav|8|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_242.wav|101|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_059.wav|15|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_206.wav|68|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_383.wav|21|And there is another problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_376.wav|39|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_059.wav|33|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_288.wav|67|I felt like I was a child.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_337.wav|85|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_181.wav|41|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_005.wav|57|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_080.wav|77|It was a total disaster.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_194.wav|13|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_185.wav|89|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_217.wav|54|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_179.wav|33|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_008.wav|37|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_050.wav|62|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_319.wav|106|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_213.wav|35|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_135.wav|3|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_335.wav|63|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_012.wav|63|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_280.wav|60|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_061.wav|37|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_102.wav|106|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_027.wav|2|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_121.wav|62|For me, it was a shattering experience.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_167.wav|42|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_343.wav|35|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_174.wav|85|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_305.wav|68|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_043.wav|31|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_281.wav|66|The manager knew me very well.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_330.wav|44|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_036.wav|19|The waiting is over, well almost.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_373.wav|37|But you never won any games.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_267.wav|106|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_225.wav|83|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_302.wav|24|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_364.wav|91|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_341.wav|5|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_355.wav|62|He, too, is killing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_081.wav|52|I do not attempt to answer that.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_049.wav|28|His art was not just about emotions.

DUMMY2/p236/p236_371.wav|75|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_496.wav|24|Subsidy income will not be affected.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_453.wav|8|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_295.wav|22|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_254.wav|79|It came in bits and pieces.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_296.wav|77|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_411.wav|8|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_060.wav|65|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_213.wav|13|We were extremely arrogant.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_368.wav|63|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_369.wav|8|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_325.wav|64|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_047.wav|37|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_262.wav|18|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_321.wav|66|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_160.wav|67|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_056.wav|96|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_403.wav|94|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_406.wav|56|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.

DUMMY2/p255/p255_001.wav|31|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_086.wav|75|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_112.wav|77|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_041.wav|99|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_104.wav|64|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_310.wav|102|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_358.wav|2|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_117.wav|40|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_303.wav|0|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_133.wav|44|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_109.wav|39|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_420.wav|75|They did the right thing.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_197.wav|79|It has been well worth it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_186.wav|47|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_368.wav|70|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_189.wav|102|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_316.wav|72|David Trimble has sold out.

DUMMY2/p283/p283_414.wav|95|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_256.wav|102|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_122.wav|100|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_030.wav|56|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_266.wav|81|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_422.wav|13|We didn't get any from his face.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_283.wav|81|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_240.wav|26|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_310.wav|56|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_312.wav|31|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_354.wav|27|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.

DUMMY2/p278/p278_359.wav|10|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_097.wav|40|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_173.wav|96|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_111.wav|61|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_207.wav|63|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_068.wav|92|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_314.wav|75|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_291.wav|54|I love the tradition of vaudeville.

DUMMY2/p284/p284_358.wav|16|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_263.wav|51|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_227.wav|3|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_143.wav|84|Is that it ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_164.wav|104|He also admitted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_315.wav|81|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_077.wav|57|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_120.wav|90|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_220.wav|5|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_243.wav|27|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_190.wav|92|He added,  It is all about the search for power.

DUMMY2/p339/p339_027.wav|18|Glasgow is far from overload.

DUMMY2/p266/p266_195.wav|20|The service from the other players was super.

DUMMY2/p307/p307_161.wav|22|There is no credible official announcement.

DUMMY2/p306/p306_013.wav|12|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_060.wav|104|I went with the mood.

DUMMY2/p244/p244_381.wav|78|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_318.wav|87|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_429.wav|8|I never won a penny throughout my career.

DUMMY2/p252/p252_380.wav|55|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_159.wav|71|"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers."
DUMMY2/p333/p333_082.wav|64|It runs until the beginning of June.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_409.wav|78|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_339.wav|3|I think the overall picture is still strong.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_212.wav|0|My life is in the ballet.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_253.wav|45|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_112.wav|25|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_121.wav|42|The General Election is all to play for.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_376.wav|60|But everywhere the problems are the same.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_090.wav|49|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_164.wav|39|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_202.wav|42|We have a high quality product.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_407.wav|65|So I moved on.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_161.wav|96|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_218.wav|39|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_069.wav|81|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_169.wav|32|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_043.wav|40|We will push.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_300.wav|68|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_479.wav|24|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_282.wav|48|There is no internal damage.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_228.wav|9|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_232.wav|53|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_348.wav|68|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_048.wav|32|Subsidy income will not be affected.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_186.wav|51|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_279.wav|15|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_284.wav|31|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_153.wav|12|We need some confidence to get a win.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_204.wav|92|That's why he is a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_108.wav|68|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_243.wav|23|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_446.wav|48|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_088.wav|91|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_038.wav|72|At half-time you have?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_219.wav|8|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_294.wav|34|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_038.wav|14|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_197.wav|97|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_308.wav|12|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_462.wav|24|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_128.wav|101|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_138.wav|1|We told them in July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_066.wav|32|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_021.wav|26|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_264.wav|14|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_288.wav|66|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_290.wav|31|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_024.wav|102|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_237.wav|40|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_396.wav|8|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_125.wav|28|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_079.wav|64|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_160.wav|41|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_070.wav|66|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_105.wav|72|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_324.wav|29|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_205.wav|100|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_190.wav|45|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_441.wav|32|I didn't get to keep it.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_028.wav|96|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_063.wav|4|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_357.wav|3|The City welcomed the numbers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_237.wav|87|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_364.wav|33|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_057.wav|86|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_405.wav|106|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_168.wav|56|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_400.wav|87|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_351.wav|11|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_316.wav|60|I don't mean in a frightening way.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_317.wav|44|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_234.wav|17|Look at the table.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_295.wav|30|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_192.wav|74|It works, as well.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_276.wav|73|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_013.wav|95|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_298.wav|44|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_097.wav|60|There is much work to do.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_318.wav|17|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_152.wav|87|We're not taking any risks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_011.wav|6|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_147.wav|23|You can be sure we will have problems.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_255.wav|28|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_218.wav|18|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_229.wav|87|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_212.wav|39|It is hard to tell.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_016.wav|102|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_084.wav|73|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_272.wav|66|Also, he was flawed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_060.wav|69|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_220.wav|8|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_203.wav|22|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_044.wav|25|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_104.wav|45|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_061.wav|43|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_336.wav|77|It was an achievement all right.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_328.wav|58|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_360.wav|18|You have to keep the focus alive.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_018.wav|99|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_102.wav|42|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_053.wav|76|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_054.wav|95|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_077.wav|21|I am about protecting the state pension.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_120.wav|17|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_381.wav|107|That is not just my personal view.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_118.wav|46|Faces from the Eighties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_413.wav|22|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_369.wav|89|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_002.wav|25|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_085.wav|51|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_139.wav|49|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_284.wav|16|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_424.wav|63|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_215.wav|33|I have had a lovely summer.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_097.wav|42|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_184.wav|8|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_111.wav|99|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_249.wav|107|It means they actually control the programme.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_199.wav|68|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_378.wav|74|What's in a name?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_016.wav|0|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_127.wav|41|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_073.wav|63|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_261.wav|33|That is very important to people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_125.wav|77|The money needs to go to the front line.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_029.wav|56|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_067.wav|76|Sandy was very active.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_260.wav|81|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_226.wav|0|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_284.wav|43|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_239.wav|48|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_035.wav|66|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_261.wav|37|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_344.wav|14|What are they for ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_090.wav|59|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_031.wav|82|It's an amazing landscape!
DUMMY2/p300/p300_100.wav|102|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_062.wav|90|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_046.wav|1|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_178.wav|38|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_152.wav|10|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_169.wav|92|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_048.wav|49|On reflection, it is more than that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_213.wav|1|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_294.wav|91|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_234.wav|78|It will be decided in the next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_250.wav|42|That is how it will be judged.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_298.wav|47|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_064.wav|55|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_381.wav|89|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_170.wav|62|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_394.wav|21|Which he is, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_058.wav|23|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_362.wav|99|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_327.wav|41|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_272.wav|50|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_325.wav|8|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_093.wav|34|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_214.wav|96|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_002.wav|70|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_103.wav|36|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_453.wav|48|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_056.wav|68|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_383.wav|94|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_227.wav|20|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_262.wav|19|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_171.wav|24|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_299.wav|51|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_038.wav|5|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_286.wav|75|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_243.wav|52|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_324.wav|51|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_313.wav|78|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_214.wav|88|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_022.wav|83|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_278.wav|49|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_296.wav|66|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_036.wav|80|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_307.wav|59|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_048.wav|9|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_408.wav|27|It might be.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_028.wav|24|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_233.wav|62|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_087.wav|28|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_265.wav|48|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_405.wav|89|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_404.wav|8|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_168.wav|58|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_190.wav|59|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_233.wav|10|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_099.wav|104|So is that it, then?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_324.wav|85|It has to reinvent itself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_292.wav|1|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_156.wav|47|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_363.wav|1|It is the way they work.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_165.wav|96|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_106.wav|10|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_355.wav|17|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_391.wav|18|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_065.wav|107|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_134.wav|75|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_045.wav|99|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_039.wav|72|The butcher is very good.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_320.wav|73|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_087.wav|71|"She told The Herald."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_353.wav|29|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_361.wav|6|It raises a serious question mark.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_212.wav|54|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_050.wav|8|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p281/p281_180.wav|36|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_055.wav|78|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_366.wav|19|The idea was presented to me.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_329.wav|70|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_310.wav|87|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_067.wav|65|Things have just worked out this way.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_468.wav|95|We are going through the process.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_078.wav|103|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_323.wav|53|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_188.wav|38|No finals are to be contested today.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_043.wav|103|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_233.wav|87|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_324.wav|55|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_338.wav|74|Let's not take too much for granted.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_047.wav|95|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_043.wav|52|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_223.wav|28|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_047.wav|84|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_271.wav|5|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_407.wav|100|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_366.wav|56|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_030.wav|42|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_084.wav|24|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_150.wav|30|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_311.wav|102|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_030.wav|96|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_460.wav|36|It must never be seen as second class.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_317.wav|24|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_314.wav|23|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_142.wav|46|I felt we needed to bring that in.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_296.wav|25|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_102.wav|70|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_293.wav|96|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_387.wav|16|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_265.wav|35|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_252.wav|9|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_203.wav|21|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_387.wav|15|Yes, it took time to recover.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_188.wav|17|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_136.wav|7|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_351.wav|68|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_403.wav|76|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_310.wav|45|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_248.wav|32|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_432.wav|65|The tie isn't over.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_377.wav|104|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_296.wav|99|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_160.wav|78|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_287.wav|26|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_143.wav|72|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_404.wav|19|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_183.wav|67|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_213.wav|78|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_005.wav|36|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_059.wav|10|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_305.wav|55|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_393.wav|106|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_394.wav|18|There is no other option.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_033.wav|23|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_011.wav|28|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_282.wav|29|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_230.wav|81|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_032.wav|92|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_291.wav|62|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_170.wav|5|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_040.wav|26|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_215.wav|15|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_447.wav|8|It was to be inclusive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_273.wav|17|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_358.wav|89|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_196.wav|33|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_118.wav|86|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_108.wav|47|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_064.wav|104|It is all about having physical evidence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_344.wav|80|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_159.wav|78|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_412.wav|32|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_182.wav|37|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_327.wav|27|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_495.wav|48|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_296.wav|47|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_071.wav|31|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_255.wav|104|There are still some matters to be discussed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_355.wav|25|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_174.wav|81|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_249.wav|72|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_393.wav|74|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_204.wav|53|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_323.wav|72|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_302.wav|40|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_345.wav|80|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_289.wav|81|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_093.wav|105|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p341/p341_372.wav|66|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_350.wav|47|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_010.wav|66|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_015.wav|25|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_345.wav|99|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_023.wav|61|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_049.wav|27|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_366.wav|107|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_216.wav|104|We're very, very excited.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_304.wav|25|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_007.wav|26|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_298.wav|10|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_393.wav|94|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_082.wav|28|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_383.wav|27|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_094.wav|43|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_240.wav|31|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_165.wav|76|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_123.wav|78|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_069.wav|103|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_298.wav|50|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_281.wav|43|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_373.wav|94|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_392.wav|69|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_403.wav|89|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_107.wav|43|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_361.wav|64|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_211.wav|2|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_328.wav|78|Another difference is the cost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_269.wav|6|She is under police escort.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_098.wav|97|Too much has already been said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_220.wav|87|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_090.wav|92|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_302.wav|10|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_281.wav|60|A press conference is about politics.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_205.wav|42|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_079.wav|22|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_130.wav|31|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_065.wav|26|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_357.wav|57|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_033.wav|43|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_231.wav|79|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_382.wav|7|He is an excellent manager.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_012.wav|71|"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "
DUMMY2/p317/p317_412.wav|97|Then one night only three people turn up.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_188.wav|75|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_150.wav|10|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_341.wav|14|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_117.wav|105|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_189.wav|3|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_066.wav|25|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_371.wav|69|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_026.wav|24|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_182.wav|23|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_422.wav|33|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_475.wav|75|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_195.wav|78|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_343.wav|97|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_280.wav|43|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_137.wav|30|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_150.wav|60|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_065.wav|16|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_409.wav|4|I was furious about it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_196.wav|39|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_223.wav|60|We are not conducting the review.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_181.wav|34|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_270.wav|91|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_049.wav|2|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_038.wav|81|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_490.wav|24|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_393.wav|92|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_073.wav|60|The bombing begins in five minutes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_054.wav|98|I'm going to buy a car.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_010.wav|51|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_062.wav|6|He did that last Sunday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_060.wav|70|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_196.wav|27|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_073.wav|71|"Neither it is."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_382.wav|22|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_177.wav|23|It's been such a long haul.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_280.wav|83|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_061.wav|83|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_173.wav|43|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_391.wav|104|Calvin was back at his best today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_043.wav|28|I read about it in the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_204.wav|84|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_285.wav|72|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_209.wav|9|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_256.wav|37|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_148.wav|73|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_094.wav|25|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_131.wav|28|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_391.wav|21|They are there to help us.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_411.wav|19|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_065.wav|89|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_332.wav|10|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_247.wav|102|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_267.wav|19|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_046.wav|2|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_022.wav|71|"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "
DUMMY2/p339/p339_351.wav|18|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_372.wav|78|The news is not all bad.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_303.wav|25|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_325.wav|38|It was a UK-wide report.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_275.wav|2|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_128.wav|48|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_301.wav|42|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_114.wav|64|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_419.wav|6|This is actually true.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_234.wav|89|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_064.wav|18|The police are not the target.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_057.wav|74|It needs a rethink.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_085.wav|16|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_036.wav|37|Let there be no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_181.wav|102|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_091.wav|7|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_192.wav|21|It has been a magical moment.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_331.wav|0|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_224.wav|33|It may not even be possible.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_046.wav|105|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_353.wav|52|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_139.wav|16|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_398.wav|92|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_098.wav|47|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_316.wav|19|But then they scored their fourth.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_203.wav|12|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_116.wav|106|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_204.wav|17|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_233.wav|6|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_098.wav|61|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_351.wav|86|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_207.wav|18|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_073.wav|58|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_126.wav|57|Who would be a referee ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_231.wav|71|"Sadly, it sounds as if it is."
DUMMY2/p240/p240_039.wav|93|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_102.wav|86|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_275.wav|8|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_120.wav|39|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_105.wav|104|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_387.wav|11|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_027.wav|15|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_323.wav|97|We are expected to do better than before.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_330.wav|37|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_315.wav|33|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_180.wav|68|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_352.wav|24|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_354.wav|45|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_030.wav|58|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_298.wav|87|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_352.wav|14|There was some merit in that.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_213.wav|55|Business will continue as usual.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_258.wav|32|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_107.wav|20|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_397.wav|7|We are really good friends.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_094.wav|86|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_108.wav|76|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_209.wav|88|This is perfectly legal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_335.wav|99|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_341.wav|61|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_426.wav|100|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_331.wav|98|That's not part of the deal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_369.wav|83|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_356.wav|84|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_108.wav|107|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_375.wav|24|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_122.wav|9|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_308.wav|45|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_351.wav|57|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_019.wav|61|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_361.wav|34|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_316.wav|4|This is not out of choice.

DUMMY2/p340/p340_043.wav|74|We can hardly talk about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_117.wav|59|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_344.wav|41|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_167.wav|34|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_288.wav|10|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_271.wav|28|Maybe it helps us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_090.wav|51|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_297.wav|65|Autumn will be a real challenge.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_050.wav|7|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_044.wav|101|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_291.wav|69|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_008.wav|90|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_071.wav|42|They can be time consuming.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_247.wav|55|It was a great evening.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_274.wav|82|And they still have the final to come.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_207.wav|106|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_134.wav|7|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_005.wav|80|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_231.wav|58|It was a big day.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_240.wav|73|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_267.wav|58|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_045.wav|45|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_316.wav|84|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_170.wav|14|Nothing was meant by it.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_062.wav|15|I feel my parents are in New York.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_114.wav|73|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_046.wav|9|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_104.wav|57|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_263.wav|47|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_299.wav|89|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_192.wav|90|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_297.wav|22|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_135.wav|30|The European Court is our only option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_157.wav|7|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_109.wav|48|People will have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_057.wav|19|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_257.wav|38|They are there to get people into work.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_147.wav|84|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_269.wav|57|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_327.wav|33|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_301.wav|26|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_080.wav|34|Who will run the bigger show?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_078.wav|9|I was too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_372.wav|37|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_141.wav|67|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_394.wav|28|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_420.wav|106|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_237.wav|41|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_199.wav|83|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_305.wav|77|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_358.wav|33|It can be frightening.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_349.wav|16|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_050.wav|69|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_129.wav|56|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_123.wav|34|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_215.wav|77|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_409.wav|46|We can't win a big game.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_058.wav|87|It was just too much for us.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_050.wav|96|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_107.wav|18|It was a bit of a tightrope.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_283.wav|92|We still have a long, long way to go.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_001.wav|19|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_137.wav|102|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_305.wav|49|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_228.wav|84|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_337.wav|23|A whole range of factors are involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_100.wav|59|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_364.wav|9|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_362.wav|25|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_057.wav|50|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_043.wav|61|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_095.wav|55|It looks that way.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_461.wav|7|It certainly appeared that way.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_086.wav|34|It's an interesting debate to get going.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_126.wav|64|This is our way to make our point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_201.wav|11|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_029.wav|3|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_127.wav|87|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_371.wav|51|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_080.wav|75|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_202.wav|89|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_182.wav|4|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_380.wav|18|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_018.wav|70|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_245.wav|41|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_050.wav|76|My brother's buried under there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_014.wav|18|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_150.wav|82|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_316.wav|2|It will work.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_263.wav|25|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_330.wav|10|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_264.wav|57|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_394.wav|76|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_322.wav|8|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_176.wav|61|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_154.wav|95|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_203.wav|57|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_379.wav|45|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_183.wav|20|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_238.wav|55|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_238.wav|18|We act because we must.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_251.wav|5|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_106.wav|25|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_297.wav|45|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_282.wav|71|"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_058.wav|51|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_197.wav|44|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_047.wav|74|I felt under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_297.wav|51|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_298.wav|15|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_217.wav|30|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_087.wav|17|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_181.wav|13|But there was no going back.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_079.wav|92|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_331.wav|48|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_025.wav|51|The Scots are, however, in good company.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_343.wav|32|After some discussion they did.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_212.wav|27|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_256.wav|56|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_244.wav|4|However, that is a sizeable if.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_003.wav|32|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p262/p262_293.wav|45|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_163.wav|28|It's always a rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_148.wav|82|His words were not audible.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_252.wav|48|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_018.wav|42|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_335.wav|96|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_217.wav|74|How can this be?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_170.wav|61|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_125.wav|50|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_160.wav|35|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_051.wav|10|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_188.wav|35|He lives in a neighbouring village.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_191.wav|60|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_303.wav|65|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_078.wav|49|History is usually written by the victors.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_238.wav|4|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_092.wav|2|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_302.wav|49|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_320.wav|21|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_316.wav|58|Instead, she just went away.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_049.wav|36|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_413.wav|16|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_137.wav|89|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_084.wav|56|He had missed a penalty against the English.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_352.wav|18|My mind is the most important thing now.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_150.wav|5|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_021.wav|24|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_246.wav|6|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_119.wav|20|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_079.wav|10|Mr Smith declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_290.wav|90|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_428.wav|24|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_202.wav|11|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_229.wav|103|It's a difficult job.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_025.wav|32|I can't play the game for them.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_264.wav|89|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_182.wav|76|From now on there is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_322.wav|83|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_026.wav|3|But we will have to wait.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_380.wav|10|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_353.wav|57|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_085.wav|45|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_317.wav|89|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_234.wav|6|I can do this on my own.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_200.wav|5|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_367.wav|67|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_226.wav|64|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_287.wav|20|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_372.wav|52|He really played us into a corner.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_311.wav|49|Hitches can be expected.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_266.wav|87|We believe in the medium term.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_043.wav|17|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_016.wav|68|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_219.wav|90|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_384.wav|72|I didn't know where they were.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_072.wav|65|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_077.wav|6|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_223.wav|25|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_009.wav|91|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_211.wav|87|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_314.wav|83|It will work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_341.wav|104|Anything can happen - at any moment.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_017.wav|58|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_399.wav|89|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_319.wav|29|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_210.wav|63|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_357.wav|48|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_297.wav|44|That is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_390.wav|47|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_096.wav|11|I'm working at the moment.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_289.wav|24|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_060.wav|11|That took a long time to happen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_409.wav|39|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_339.wav|73|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_141.wav|41|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_186.wav|63|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_354.wav|99|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_359.wav|19|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_084.wav|107|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_089.wav|84|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_114.wav|38|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_260.wav|34|There is nothing sinister in it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_137.wav|68|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_362.wav|17|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_049.wav|3|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_404.wav|36|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_265.wav|53|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_005.wav|9|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_252.wav|57|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_165.wav|62|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_279.wav|5|It is so very obvious.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_137.wav|3|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_276.wav|58|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_071.wav|57|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_190.wav|1|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_344.wav|11|It was not being marketed properly.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_054.wav|49|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_428.wav|14|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_357.wav|98|Things don't look too good at the moment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_337.wav|56|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_288.wav|9|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_163.wav|23|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_347.wav|101|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_120.wav|91|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_240.wav|99|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_149.wav|25|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_064.wav|57|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_049.wav|88|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_054.wav|46|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_236.wav|71|"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet."
DUMMY2/p374/p374_148.wav|11|There is something in this.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_255.wav|73|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_241.wav|49|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_356.wav|38|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_082.wav|95|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_164.wav|45|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_247.wav|62|And does it?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_205.wav|87|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_293.wav|44|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_134.wav|104|I have had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_402.wav|29|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_383.wav|66|Chris Paterson is a class act.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_308.wav|77|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_413.wav|36|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_216.wav|99|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_409.wav|13|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_175.wav|35|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_356.wav|83|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_094.wav|69|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_233.wav|103|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_096.wav|42|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_180.wav|24|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_119.wav|43|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_115.wav|8|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_082.wav|47|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_081.wav|63|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_151.wav|10|Nothing was meant by it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_234.wav|56|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_192.wav|98|Don't hold your breath!
DUMMY2/p316/p316_104.wav|85|That got me out.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_004.wav|63|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_259.wav|41|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_276.wav|106|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_039.wav|9|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_440.wav|8|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_096.wav|74|It is a matter of clarity.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_200.wav|8|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_282.wav|88|It would be dangerous to resign.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_253.wav|11|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_223.wav|91|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_297.wav|66|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_461.wav|50|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_161.wav|39|I have had a good life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_204.wav|105|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_002.wav|31|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_011.wav|104|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_043.wav|44|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_241.wav|21|We did not complete the process.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_129.wav|44|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_299.wav|24|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_118.wav|30|Stalkers are capable of killing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_025.wav|92|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_076.wav|28|I was shocked and outraged.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_335.wav|11|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_119.wav|2|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_230.wav|25|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_385.wav|1|It was a very difficult decision for us.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_104.wav|76|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_397.wav|16|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_029.wav|35|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_324.wav|23|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_218.wav|12|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_334.wav|99|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_305.wav|50|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_101.wav|37|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_430.wav|65|Equipment is also a problem.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_083.wav|97|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_078.wav|63|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_188.wav|95|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_396.wav|2|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_114.wav|34|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_047.wav|77|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_217.wav|68|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_008.wav|34|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_140.wav|23|I've been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_180.wav|41|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_126.wav|38|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_129.wav|19|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_204.wav|12|Donald was a man with many friends.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_048.wav|22|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_259.wav|17|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_292.wav|43|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_283.wav|74|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_076.wav|41|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_386.wav|23|Michael's putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_104.wav|104|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_489.wav|24|He is not a dancer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_108.wav|58|He has one son and one daughter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_071.wav|12|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_185.wav|24|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_230.wav|29|He must get to know himself.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_295.wav|91|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_314.wav|48|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_166.wav|83|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_326.wav|48|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_150.wav|79|And it was great for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_369.wav|33|This was not the show for me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_021.wav|23|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_198.wav|67|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_007.wav|32|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p266/p266_193.wav|20|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_075.wav|94|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_059.wav|92|I knew there was a challenge for me.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_287.wav|19|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_021.wav|5|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_261.wav|59|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_027.wav|13|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_352.wav|51|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_148.wav|78|I am the manager of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_250.wav|36|That is still in place.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_290.wav|59|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_238.wav|84|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_251.wav|57|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_130.wav|80|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_277.wav|91|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_377.wav|58|Chris Paterson is a class act.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_282.wav|75|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_291.wav|99|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_261.wav|29|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_025.wav|17|He was the youngest of the British team.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_031.wav|58|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_295.wav|78|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_018.wav|17|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_057.wav|65|Do I have a favourite?)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_072.wav|68|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_264.wav|67|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_054.wav|29|I could not do it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_089.wav|3|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_272.wav|13|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_222.wav|31|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_080.wav|52|They said our costs were too high.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_297.wav|59|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_079.wav|7|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_368.wav|82|Anything that was going, really.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_192.wav|75|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_232.wav|43|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_074.wav|39|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_140.wav|88|It won the match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_325.wav|36|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_304.wav|84|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_231.wav|98|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_010.wav|94|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_023.wav|30|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_423.wav|105|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_002.wav|53|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_021.wav|93|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_295.wav|96|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_126.wav|24|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_136.wav|95|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_193.wav|106|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_325.wav|13|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_184.wav|2|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_041.wav|20|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_313.wav|70|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_368.wav|103|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_113.wav|37|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_451.wav|36|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_207.wav|32|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_044.wav|50|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_033.wav|48|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_356.wav|36|It is all about having physical evidence.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_055.wav|83|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_211.wav|66|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_335.wav|41|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_016.wav|92|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_306.wav|92|We're all going to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_045.wav|21|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_233.wav|106|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_267.wav|74|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_116.wav|54|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_465.wav|48|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_131.wav|58|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_186.wav|64|No, they have not.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_276.wav|78|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_342.wav|8|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_010.wav|87|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_211.wav|86|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_317.wav|7|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_053.wav|32|We felt it was sufficient.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_026.wav|35|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_152.wav|73|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_225.wav|0|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_130.wav|74|You need that freedom in society.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_287.wav|107|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_157.wav|102|You might even have seen him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_057.wav|16|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_144.wav|43|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_255.wav|13|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_455.wav|48|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_003.wav|96|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_315.wav|104|The document is a starting point for discussion.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_176.wav|67|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_278.wav|93|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_155.wav|69|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_196.wav|62|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_179.wav|2|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_090.wav|83|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_206.wav|74|They are very clever and very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_351.wav|27|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_370.wav|40|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_435.wav|24|No date has been fixed for his return.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_258.wav|10|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_400.wav|47|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_160.wav|60|However, we will have to wait and see.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_168.wav|98|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_278.wav|20|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_076.wav|93|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_262.wav|86|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_280.wav|18|But that's another story.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_351.wav|79|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_099.wav|20|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_079.wav|61|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_199.wav|39|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_271.wav|0|It disappeared into the cup.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_263.wav|41|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_356.wav|15|They will do something big.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_346.wav|69|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_341.wav|106|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_091.wav|9|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_228.wav|49|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_401.wav|64|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_019.wav|22|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_166.wav|29|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_335.wav|18|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_062.wav|32|It's not covered by the insurance.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_085.wav|52|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_109.wav|99|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_246.wav|66|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_015.wav|0|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_390.wav|79|It is planned for London in the spring.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_046.wav|30|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_040.wav|49|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_402.wav|47|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_205.wav|43|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_332.wav|79|Yet the job is far from over.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_035.wav|106|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_227.wav|28|I was very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_047.wav|27|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_243.wav|48|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_174.wav|26|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_210.wav|38|You have obviously got an answer to it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_048.wav|102|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_356.wav|1|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_029.wav|46|So now this series has had its day.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_474.wav|24|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_218.wav|1|You remember how long he lasted?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_047.wav|38|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_336.wav|28|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_092.wav|14|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_134.wav|30|It has been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_190.wav|86|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_098.wav|94|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_068.wav|102|How things have changed since then.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_176.wav|31|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_364.wav|24|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_016.wav|59|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_156.wav|64|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_397.wav|48|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_106.wav|23|It was different in the endurance events.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_073.wav|93|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_016.wav|9|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_240.wav|34|The key issue for us is public safety.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_160.wav|39|She will do for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_193.wav|95|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_080.wav|31|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_084.wav|84|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_133.wav|10|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_379.wav|100|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_346.wav|61|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_151.wav|72|I'm pleased for him.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_141.wav|84|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_214.wav|84|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_350.wav|43|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_307.wav|80|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_396.wav|92|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_369.wav|99|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_231.wav|103|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_337.wav|78|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_216.wav|89|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_337.wav|42|You are going to take away my life.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_140.wav|17|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_248.wav|98|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_421.wav|74|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_320.wav|96|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_333.wav|103|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_303.wav|34|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_256.wav|75|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_150.wav|31|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_345.wav|61|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_094.wav|26|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_198.wav|92|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_421.wav|50|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_377.wav|34|He asked how they were doing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_377.wav|23|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_159.wav|69|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_457.wav|95|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_107.wav|37|Their mandate is to target inflation.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_068.wav|1|I think it is a release of tension.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_084.wav|32|They lived for their children.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_274.wav|100|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_066.wav|18|But that title is a mistake.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_017.wav|31|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_271.wav|83|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_152.wav|2|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_161.wav|29|They want to see him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_310.wav|16|You should be.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_341.wav|10|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_145.wav|19|However, it is not all bad news for women.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_310.wav|52|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_101.wav|78|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_265.wav|63|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_083.wav|2|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_385.wav|87|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_203.wav|16|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_015.wav|61|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_355.wav|94|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_085.wav|10|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_138.wav|26|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_233.wav|44|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_257.wav|47|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_178.wav|72|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_245.wav|5|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_393.wav|39|She has a little boy.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_264.wav|28|She's now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_100.wav|56|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_031.wav|88|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_088.wav|38|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_238.wav|37|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_341.wav|11|I'm looking forward to that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_133.wav|42|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_300.wav|23|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_309.wav|78|But it is a similar problem.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_243.wav|35|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_106.wav|96|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_046.wav|10|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_215.wav|39|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_335.wav|5|He loved the moment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_030.wav|20|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_081.wav|87|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_385.wav|103|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_035.wav|27|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_416.wav|76|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_202.wav|91|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_101.wav|92|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_146.wav|16|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_312.wav|87|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_258.wav|44|They have a very good method of working.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_203.wav|90|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_027.wav|28|She is an angel.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_175.wav|61|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_392.wav|47|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_265.wav|95|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_348.wav|56|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_223.wav|47|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_041.wav|38|It was an accounting error.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_080.wav|65|Put simply, it goes something like this.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_345.wav|49|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_419.wav|63|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_069.wav|91|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_033.wav|99|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_294.wav|31|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_040.wav|93|It's a real threat.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_005.wav|96|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_153.wav|107|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_286.wav|78|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_033.wav|5|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_210.wav|15|What do you want to say?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_217.wav|107|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_297.wav|67|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_320.wav|2|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_016.wav|8|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_317.wav|36|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_114.wav|91|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_219.wav|101|They did not attack the themes of the book.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_216.wav|30|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_123.wav|55|They pointed to the site.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_443.wav|24|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_276.wav|55|All films open tomorrow
DUMMY2/p288/p288_001.wav|47|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_362.wav|92|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_014.wav|28|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_211.wav|16|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_340.wav|21|We're not comparing like with like.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_093.wav|95|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_083.wav|36|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_246.wav|89|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_035.wav|46|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_316.wav|50|We're on our way.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_016.wav|25|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_001.wav|104|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_313.wav|76|Some of their movement was excellent.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_079.wav|65|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_158.wav|105|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_192.wav|76|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_382.wav|87|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_095.wav|74|He said he never saw it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_470.wav|7|They were good years for him.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_121.wav|66|We are going to go about our lives.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_363.wav|91|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_074.wav|74|I'm sure that they will learn.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_063.wav|2|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_019.wav|97|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_104.wav|37|That would be the case with Dundee.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_334.wav|35|It was always an option.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_422.wav|14|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_128.wav|49|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_262.wav|81|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_331.wav|103|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_143.wav|98|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_422.wav|63|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_280.wav|45|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_134.wav|19|At some point, the bill will be presented.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_398.wav|82|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_231.wav|66|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_358.wav|102|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_355.wav|83|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_341.wav|55|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_384.wav|85|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_239.wav|54|So the process was refined.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_167.wav|44|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_005.wav|88|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_276.wav|68|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_256.wav|36|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_258.wav|82|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_063.wav|77|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_105.wav|12|People just came on their own.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_055.wav|14|We have to keep our clients.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_271.wav|18|It was my whole life.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_040.wav|81|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_308.wav|94|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_130.wav|8|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_191.wav|1|It has all been positive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_175.wav|38|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_325.wav|53|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_145.wav|56|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_161.wav|42|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_342.wav|35|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_130.wav|13|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_120.wav|3|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_351.wav|91|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_385.wav|53|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_231.wav|6|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_354.wav|40|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_279.wav|76|Why should he go anywhere?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_086.wav|50|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_259.wav|30|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_132.wav|26|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_137.wav|15|There is a subtle difference.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_285.wav|62|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_167.wav|0|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_275.wav|86|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_223.wav|83|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_004.wav|47|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_266.wav|36|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_265.wav|18|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_317.wav|26|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_253.wav|40|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_192.wav|15|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_402.wav|33|It has proved a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_339.wav|23|They would love to do more films.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_309.wav|74|What is their concern?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_162.wav|80|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_343.wav|23|It raises a serious question mark.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_041.wav|54|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_354.wav|52|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_228.wav|53|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_040.wav|34|They were not up to speed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_017.wav|5|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_045.wav|43|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_388.wav|49|I can't believe what has happened.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_248.wav|1|The principle is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_026.wav|102|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_221.wav|45|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_184.wav|23|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_219.wav|83|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_380.wav|13|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_256.wav|71|"There is no link."
DUMMY2/p281/p281_443.wav|36|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_328.wav|49|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_400.wav|65|The tickets are on their way.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_187.wav|49|We do things in an appropriate way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_323.wav|26|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_327.wav|98|One would not want to go there anyway.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_013.wav|36|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.

DUMMY2/p251/p251_169.wav|9|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_121.wav|51|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_250.wav|90|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_364.wav|96|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_118.wav|94|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_070.wav|99|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_006.wav|101|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_321.wav|99|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_076.wav|76|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_228.wav|15|Sadly, they did not.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_292.wav|62|Trevor has been great.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_374.wav|64|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_364.wav|64|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_071.wav|49|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_067.wav|42|BIG Brother is listening to you.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_035.wav|16|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_016.wav|13|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_335.wav|16|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_035.wav|50|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_252.wav|11|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_409.wav|33|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_318.wav|4|But this one has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_298.wav|36|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_042.wav|80|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_069.wav|96|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_426.wav|65|She had black eyes.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_186.wav|104|The fire was falling from the sky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_334.wav|61|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_007.wav|77|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_388.wav|72|But let's not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_209.wav|105|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_200.wav|44|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_374.wav|67|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_300.wav|9|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_083.wav|73|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_054.wav|68|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_135.wav|21|It's about doing things.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_048.wav|91|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_317.wav|32|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_362.wav|58|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_045.wav|0|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_146.wav|64|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_138.wav|67|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_129.wav|8|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_317.wav|77|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_252.wav|63|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_363.wav|94|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_039.wav|57|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_303.wav|52|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_278.wav|40|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_177.wav|92|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_324.wav|10|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_226.wav|23|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_338.wav|33|That's just the kind of thing we have.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_288.wav|39|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_160.wav|9|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_274.wav|23|There are two offerings from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_181.wav|44|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_372.wav|102|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_020.wav|3|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_378.wav|32|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_032.wav|39|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_268.wav|46|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_361.wav|54|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_422.wav|42|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_324.wav|97|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_130.wav|15|But he thought the overall results were good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_502.wav|75|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_165.wav|5|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_064.wav|68|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_232.wav|88|What do you do?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_030.wav|22|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_160.wav|10|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_288.wav|61|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_174.wav|107|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_279.wav|47|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_050.wav|106|But not a penny has been paid.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_056.wav|76|I've really noticed that this week.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_415.wav|32|It's just a training thing.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_430.wav|32|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_322.wav|47|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_222.wav|37|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_389.wav|41|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_278.wav|69|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_185.wav|27|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_048.wav|35|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_280.wav|79|I can't wait for it to come out.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_163.wav|104|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_437.wav|106|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_393.wav|11|They do it properly.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_263.wav|64|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_412.wav|75|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_205.wav|58|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_292.wav|76|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_280.wav|71|"Parents should avoid it."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_329.wav|10|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_246.wav|48|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_330.wav|64|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_401.wav|29|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_246.wav|30|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_341.wav|24|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_367.wav|45|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_053.wav|9|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_250.wav|19|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_296.wav|79|What do you think?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_152.wav|30|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_451.wav|24|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_408.wav|0|We will stand for the nation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_463.wav|7|Quality was high in all sections.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_222.wav|61|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_146.wav|61|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_331.wav|18|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_006.wav|19|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_045.wav|10|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_240.wav|30|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_168.wav|105|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_203.wav|75|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p232/p232_170.wav|96|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_076.wav|99|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_167.wav|53|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_077.wav|80|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_010.wav|21|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_466.wav|50|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_117.wav|97|We must get the three points.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_098.wav|107|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_168.wav|78|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_356.wav|26|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_405.wav|46|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_193.wav|26|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_080.wav|14|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_074.wav|7|It makes for an interesting conference.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_054.wav|40|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_254.wav|93|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_185.wav|63|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_322.wav|32|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_161.wav|59|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_428.wav|100|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_389.wav|40|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_113.wav|58|He had other things on his mind.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_325.wav|97|I am not even thinking about that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_218.wav|43|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_417.wav|36|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_208.wav|57|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_191.wav|7|We've just had it confirmed.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_031.wav|61|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_234.wav|3|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_307.wav|35|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_215.wav|91|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_068.wav|0|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_080.wav|30|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_199.wav|91|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_253.wav|84|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_119.wav|23|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_314.wav|79|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_011.wav|65|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p312/p312_179.wav|62|You can't keep them separate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_148.wav|85|Feel for five seconds.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_159.wav|36|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_356.wav|28|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_343.wav|63|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_293.wav|2|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_400.wav|17|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_132.wav|48|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_072.wav|104|I found the course inspiring.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_150.wav|91|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_282.wav|10|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_370.wav|17|Alex is a big part of that future.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_409.wav|70|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_170.wav|82|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_128.wav|27|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_317.wav|13|He was always nice to me.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_062.wav|41|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_016.wav|79|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_022.wav|107|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_267.wav|78|But we were in control at that point.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_337.wav|68|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_106.wav|38|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_228.wav|12|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_169.wav|26|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_360.wav|28|There is no musical background in his family.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_167.wav|63|It should never have happened.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_021.wav|60|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_023.wav|50|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_373.wav|82|The winner will be announced in December.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_332.wav|70|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_015.wav|55|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_235.wav|89|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_314.wav|2|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_009.wav|33|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_167.wav|82|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_449.wav|27|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_190.wav|38|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_279.wav|46|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_188.wav|37|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_294.wav|24|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_298.wav|11|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_333.wav|68|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_042.wav|18|It was electric, amazing.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_264.wav|19|We are playing them at their own game.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_302.wav|53|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_060.wav|84|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_295.wav|27|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_252.wav|58|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_099.wav|11|He loved it, and so did they.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_122.wav|66|He had other things on his mind.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_249.wav|1|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_046.wav|25|We will push.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_385.wav|55|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_390.wav|64|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_304.wav|88|This was repeated the second time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_025.wav|100|They are very clever in their use of words.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_172.wav|48|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_230.wav|82|They are very frightened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_240.wav|16|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_109.wav|0|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_374.wav|72|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_062.wav|84|That is all in the past.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_280.wav|61|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_381.wav|105|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_097.wav|39|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_400.wav|72|It is the worst of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_116.wav|52|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_121.wav|105|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_249.wav|46|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_064.wav|54|This rule is archaic.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_225.wav|38|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_346.wav|3|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_145.wav|103|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_259.wav|59|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_336.wav|104|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_266.wav|45|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_290.wav|61|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_053.wav|89|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_342.wav|81|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_350.wav|48|Translation - we got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_184.wav|47|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_269.wav|79|We call it marriage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_147.wav|0|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_210.wav|74|I had just taken it off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_068.wav|106|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_213.wav|60|An announcement is expected soon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_136.wav|104|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_132.wav|27|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_117.wav|60|This is a classic.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_201.wav|49|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_276.wav|72|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_425.wav|106|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_055.wav|53|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_264.wav|9|We are ready.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_139.wav|15|He didn't get out much.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_014.wav|77|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_284.wav|83|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_194.wav|65|So what happens next?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_345.wav|27|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_003.wav|7|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p317/p317_250.wav|97|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_318.wav|62|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_348.wav|53|And that is the bottom line - box office.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_132.wav|99|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_171.wav|96|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_024.wav|105|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_381.wav|106|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_199.wav|60|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_358.wav|13|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_267.wav|32|I should think so, too.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_294.wav|12|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_076.wav|6|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_284.wav|35|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_234.wav|95|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_009.wav|68|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_340.wav|89|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_418.wav|100|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_460.wav|37|It is business as usual.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_369.wav|57|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_079.wav|12|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_242.wav|13|His musicals were very much of their time.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_096.wav|76|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_371.wav|42|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_246.wav|55|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_227.wav|105|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_090.wav|32|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_296.wav|3|The results are expected within days.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_058.wav|81|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_331.wav|10|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_408.wav|62|There was someone on the floor.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_001.wav|57|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_311.wav|106|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_091.wav|65|They are a different team at home.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_180.wav|6|Will he be here for the weekend?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_195.wav|3|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_300.wav|54|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_217.wav|43|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_296.wav|64|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_101.wav|89|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_431.wav|106|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_158.wav|27|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_363.wav|51|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_160.wav|97|How can you not react?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_329.wav|40|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_119.wav|82|I'll just have to live with that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_089.wav|31|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_186.wav|95|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_265.wav|25|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_450.wav|24|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_232.wav|15|That had never happened.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_141.wav|71|"There is a lack of chemistry."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_051.wav|96|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_333.wav|33|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_241.wav|50|The parties have no contact.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_013.wav|85|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_245.wav|58|Mind you, who wouldn't?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_129.wav|18|I don't think the referees are against us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_146.wav|24|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_431.wav|89|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_022.wav|57|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_156.wav|78|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_282.wav|77|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_005.wav|27|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_417.wav|100|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_336.wav|94|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_295.wav|45|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_192.wav|103|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_226.wav|22|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_030.wav|43|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_371.wav|0|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_294.wav|61|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_306.wav|8|Selection is not in my hands at all.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_225.wav|103|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_320.wav|72|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_177.wav|21|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_110.wav|10|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_091.wav|95|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_377.wav|93|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_419.wav|78|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_332.wav|97|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_090.wav|89|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_331.wav|41|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_001.wav|91|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_111.wav|2|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_317.wav|48|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_076.wav|70|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_004.wav|36|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_300.wav|14|It's all designed to speed up the service.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_372.wav|106|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_049.wav|77|It is quite a figure.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_017.wav|62|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_244.wav|66|It was a big day.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_014.wav|6|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_320.wav|14|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_090.wav|57|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_016.wav|2|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_069.wav|28|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_258.wav|61|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_316.wav|102|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_399.wav|51|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_275.wav|15|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_275.wav|94|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_049.wav|64|You can't give in to the vandals.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_209.wav|68|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_393.wav|2|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_396.wav|53|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_074.wav|66|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_287.wav|88|It does and it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_312.wav|51|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_368.wav|77|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_239.wav|66|I lost it at the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_335.wav|100|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_161.wav|53|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_243.wav|36|This is the year of the Tiger.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_323.wav|81|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_319.wav|7|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_092.wav|13|His presence was very important.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_413.wav|18|I saw it later in the news.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_108.wav|24|We knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_223.wav|65|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_131.wav|51|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_126.wav|28|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_204.wav|27|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_421.wav|78|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_308.wav|44|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_095.wav|37|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_226.wav|16|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_219.wav|69|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_279.wav|31|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_127.wav|12|I went straight to the toilet.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_061.wav|1|I find it rather oppressive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_296.wav|38|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_057.wav|94|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_365.wav|36|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_300.wav|0|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_370.wav|97|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_455.wav|37|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_307.wav|16|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_203.wav|64|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_310.wav|42|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_391.wav|94|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_337.wav|10|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_276.wav|64|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_117.wav|48|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_365.wav|29|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_142.wav|44|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_128.wav|90|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_290.wav|84|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_056.wav|67|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_208.wav|60|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_266.wav|67|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_080.wav|38|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_179.wav|50|But one was not enough.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_376.wav|6|He was a legend.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_387.wav|1|Was it just negligent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_091.wav|3|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_246.wav|11|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_208.wav|89|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_305.wav|86|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_171.wav|64|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_169.wav|30|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_386.wav|7|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_123.wav|77|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_182.wav|25|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_212.wav|50|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_174.wav|96|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_158.wav|30|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_109.wav|21|Not that it was needed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_015.wav|29|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_180.wav|102|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_070.wav|13|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_367.wav|22|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_346.wav|75|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_005.wav|98|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_185.wav|7|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_422.wav|24|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_154.wav|68|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_097.wav|47|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_327.wav|19|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_042.wav|23|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_344.wav|4|They will now get that support.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_144.wav|75|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_024.wav|88|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_469.wav|100|They are defined by law.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_012.wav|29|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_132.wav|20|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_232.wav|69|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_273.wav|54|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_001.wav|28|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_183.wav|78|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_034.wav|49|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_226.wav|87|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_389.wav|33|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_309.wav|82|A counter reaction was.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_240.wav|85|It is the men who create the demand.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_177.wav|99|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p236/p236_356.wav|75|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_096.wav|95|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_373.wav|36|The shares are a strong hold.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_067.wav|78|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_288.wav|51|The alliance said it may not wait.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_131.wav|30|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_396.wav|35|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_146.wav|0|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_155.wav|100|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_292.wav|83|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_363.wav|47|So I left.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_121.wav|67|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_311.wav|60|The meaning is very profound and complex.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_155.wav|17|We started with that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_389.wav|37|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_150.wav|29|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_040.wav|51|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_234.wav|76|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_079.wav|17|He would be with his peers.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_160.wav|38|That is not just my personal view.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_235.wav|87|They've got some extremely good players.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_079.wav|1|I could do a better job.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_064.wav|22|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_135.wav|56|Behind him was his brother.

DUMMY2/p310/p310_003.wav|17|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_129.wav|106|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_113.wav|13|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_375.wav|96|It was a double tragedy for the family.

DUMMY2/p288/p288_388.wav|47|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_374.wav|31|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_365.wav|18|This is a new beginning.

DUMMY2/p232/p232_196.wav|96|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_219.wav|59|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_068.wav|37|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_278.wav|27|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_116.wav|12|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_338.wav|103|It might have been a satanic ritual.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_406.wav|52|We were on top and could have won.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_395.wav|21|Each one is as good as the other.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_072.wav|62|It showed him the way to drive.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_422.wav|54|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_169.wav|56|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_064.wav|91|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_045.wav|58|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_265.wav|20|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_032.wav|13|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.

DUMMY2/p279/p279_058.wav|25|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.

DUMMY2/p227/p227_305.wav|29|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_092.wav|80|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_046.wav|88|So what did he do?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_135.wav|70|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_429.wav|48|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_259.wav|44|Do you think you have a shot?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_137.wav|58|They can be time consuming.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_167.wav|74|It is clear that change is required.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_355.wav|59|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_032.wav|104|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_247.wav|93|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_386.wav|97|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_174.wav|49|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_366.wav|14|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_032.wav|67|Because we do not need it.

DUMMY2/p260/p260_319.wav|81|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_383.wav|46|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_104.wav|83|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_273.wav|25|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_133.wav|65|I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_278.wav|103|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_085.wav|48|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_310.wav|93|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_095.wav|84|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_340.wav|82|Now it was serious.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_184.wav|39|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_029.wav|42|I feel strongly about it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_210.wav|76|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_045.wav|28|They say they feel different.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_094.wav|84|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_369.wav|28|Broke down and can't be fixed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_038.wav|105|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_183.wav|4|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_106.wav|45|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_356.wav|81|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_182.wav|12|She is living proof of their expertise.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_342.wav|52|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_331.wav|75|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_312.wav|25|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_227.wav|9|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_334.wav|15|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_360.wav|74|It is working well.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_275.wav|45|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_315.wav|48|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_100.wav|83|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_332.wav|68|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_366.wav|95|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_023.wav|34|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_046.wav|58|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_370.wav|92|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_165.wav|88|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_189.wav|103|I think it's awful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_292.wav|36|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_026.wav|29|Movement has to take place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_074.wav|16|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_114.wav|75|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_237.wav|23|That was my own personal decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_281.wav|69|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_056.wav|59|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_399.wav|52|I think it's a big advantage to us.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_340.wav|85|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_005.wav|102|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_036.wav|28|It was my shortest audition.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_024.wav|39|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_352.wav|56|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_135.wav|2|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_309.wav|63|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_054.wav|93|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_430.wav|106|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_043.wav|55|This operation will change her life.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_386.wav|34|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_321.wav|35|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_033.wav|41|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_392.wav|28|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_219.wav|92|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_111.wav|69|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_348.wav|80|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_421.wav|98|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_159.wav|4|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_036.wav|46|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_089.wav|106|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_100.wav|33|He confirmed that the document was valid.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_192.wav|1|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_016.wav|64|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_435.wav|63|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_143.wav|62|It's a fantastic achievement.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_298.wav|9|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_154.wav|91|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_315.wav|54|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_156.wav|67|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_401.wav|95|I could not live with it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_244.wav|29|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_293.wav|37|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_254.wav|78|I was never in danger.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_394.wav|6|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_247.wav|107|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_223.wav|48|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_130.wav|102|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_342.wav|3|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_069.wav|89|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_077.wav|7|I wanted to change the formula.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_321.wav|44|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_023.wav|59|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_004.wav|98|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_267.wav|6|It will be a challenging film.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_296.wav|7|These figures are truly terrible.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_200.wav|69|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_014.wav|33|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_192.wav|10|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_175.wav|91|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_331.wav|82|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_384.wav|21|That is the theory.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_280.wav|35|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_174.wav|28|We are already under pressure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_314.wav|40|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_440.wav|32|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_295.wav|85|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_307.wav|60|They are not falling now.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_343.wav|68|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_135.wav|65|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_126.wav|92|You have a very persuasive president.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_050.wav|40|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_228.wav|22|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_400.wav|24|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_100.wav|30|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_351.wav|51|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_397.wav|27|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_137.wav|28|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_200.wav|55|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_011.wav|83|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_367.wav|33|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_201.wav|92|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_146.wav|10|I haven't made any definite decisions.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_070.wav|48|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_397.wav|17|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_339.wav|44|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_270.wav|26|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_065.wav|43|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_140.wav|63|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_165.wav|71|"Military action is the only option we have on the table today."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_211.wav|75|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_066.wav|80|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_152.wav|26|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_110.wav|25|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_398.wav|85|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_269.wav|48|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_123.wav|92|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_446.wav|39|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_252.wav|44|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_179.wav|46|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_085.wav|43|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_017.wav|8|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_104.wav|27|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_038.wav|96|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_136.wav|58|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_051.wav|92|I think it was entirely the right decision.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_044.wav|8|Not if you know the person.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_079.wav|89|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_104.wav|69|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_357.wav|77|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_008.wav|47|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_292.wav|50|I've lost all confidence.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_422.wav|78|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_409.wav|56|Russell is delighted with them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_140.wav|29|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_234.wav|50|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_181.wav|17|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_169.wav|91|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_129.wav|94|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_152.wav|20|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_130.wav|61|It's terrible that he has died the same way.

DUMMY2/p233/p233_027.wav|84|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_340.wav|65|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_169.wav|64|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_295.wav|67|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_170.wav|44|That, in our view, is an important decision.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_373.wav|22|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_059.wav|72|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_005.wav|82|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_008.wav|23|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_124.wav|55|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_259.wav|43|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_418.wav|13|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_041.wav|76|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_086.wav|26|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_087.wav|35|It was not an insult.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_178.wav|88|We want him to continue that way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_418.wav|92|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_256.wav|52|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_271.wav|24|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_393.wav|21|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_191.wav|72|There is a demand for another hospice.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_254.wav|19|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_079.wav|15|I don't know what it means.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_272.wav|22|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_078.wav|48|I haven't got there yet.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_150.wav|57|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_215.wav|50|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_034.wav|1|They could move in at any moment.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_044.wav|83|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_409.wav|49|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_308.wav|29|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_064.wav|15|Seems a sensible compromise.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_120.wav|40|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_225.wav|80|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_120.wav|83|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_262.wav|0|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_383.wav|34|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_082.wav|87|But I had never been in a theatre.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_065.wav|40|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_372.wav|33|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_265.wav|99|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_109.wav|106|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_025.wav|88|Is that not pathetic?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_132.wav|38|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_132.wav|1|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_003.wav|50|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_077.wav|85|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_276.wav|91|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_049.wav|57|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_266.wav|105|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_303.wav|69|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_304.wav|21|Is it the flight?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_319.wav|53|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_338.wav|37|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_392.wav|91|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_043.wav|21|We've all been here before.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_449.wav|65|The festival runs until Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_329.wav|107|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_276.wav|48|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_015.wav|53|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_320.wav|52|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_479.wav|7|Some problems were too complex.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_174.wav|58|He was as good as his word.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_216.wav|62|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_302.wav|43|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_171.wav|102|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_149.wav|63|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_031.wav|95|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_285.wav|26|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_417.wav|97|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_177.wav|5|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_354.wav|6|I am not sure.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_376.wav|18|They want it to work.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_111.wav|79|I'm not looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_390.wav|106|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_170.wav|77|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_126.wav|56|We'll have to think about it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_226.wav|81|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_034.wav|77|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_023.wav|28|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_389.wav|63|The director will be present.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_072.wav|78|It is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_365.wav|76|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_033.wav|20|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_053.wav|53|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_165.wav|12|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_237.wav|36|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_089.wav|28|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_117.wav|54|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_290.wav|35|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_334.wav|74|Would that be for men and women?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_224.wav|103|It is a step on the way.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_451.wav|48|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_244.wav|96|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_086.wav|8|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_128.wav|78|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_237.wav|74|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_307.wav|62|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_224.wav|54|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_088.wav|92|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_292.wav|11|Just a year later he was dead.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_036.wav|31|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_032.wav|106|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_099.wav|22|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_180.wav|22|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_257.wav|22|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_434.wav|106|The company declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_381.wav|22|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_123.wav|32|What happened in that game ?)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_174.wav|62|I cannot say anymore.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_216.wav|61|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_166.wav|62|And who would argue with that?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_229.wav|1|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_107.wav|99|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_081.wav|32|It took an option on the process.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_105.wav|79|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_018.wav|16|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_097.wav|48|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_009.wav|106|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_205.wav|32|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_199.wav|38|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_224.wav|71|"We're looking for justice."
DUMMY2/p229/p229_109.wav|67|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_388.wav|16|It's like a car crash.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_035.wav|77|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_007.wav|63|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_189.wav|99|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_192.wav|104|You can't believe a word.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_326.wav|35|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_284.wav|53|The fans pay for their season tickets.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_023.wav|7|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p265/p265_100.wav|73|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_352.wav|27|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_131.wav|12|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_137.wav|1|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_185.wav|78|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_358.wav|43|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_405.wav|68|He showed he has some things to learn.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_065.wav|19|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_238.wav|49|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_402.wav|87|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_316.wav|56|Scotland has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_050.wav|60|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_002.wav|24|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_021.wav|84|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_219.wav|36|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_372.wav|46|You realise what this means?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_368.wav|56|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_336.wav|31|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_294.wav|62|Rather than answer, she resigned.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_086.wav|81|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_147.wav|21|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_081.wav|57|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_405.wav|34|The house was full of smoke.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_132.wav|92|I can't see myself in one of those.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_325.wav|32|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_329.wav|42|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_330.wav|55|We want immediate action.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_181.wav|98|This is not the case.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_350.wav|41|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_072.wav|7|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_331.wav|81|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_271.wav|40|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_170.wav|42|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_001.wav|33|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_118.wav|28|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_132.wav|71|"It's not true."
DUMMY2/p305/p305_123.wav|54|There has been no delay on government orders.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_362.wav|95|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_120.wav|69|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_077.wav|23|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_021.wav|34|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_265.wav|68|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_093.wav|91|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_351.wav|49|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_040.wav|50|Last year, I was pretty bad.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_286.wav|57|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_416.wav|15|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_225.wav|2|But she was.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_242.wav|23|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_160.wav|19|He had never run the distance before.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_428.wav|39|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_159.wav|6|We still have to wait for that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_033.wav|79|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_234.wav|106|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_061.wav|87|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_087.wav|84|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_053.wav|106|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_094.wav|77|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_305.wav|95|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_014.wav|80|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_090.wav|22|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_036.wav|83|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_427.wav|65|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_105.wav|74|We believe it to be completely without merit.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_394.wav|66|Maybe, who knows?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_141.wav|73|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_182.wav|90|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_407.wav|70|That may be.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_289.wav|5|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_249.wav|7|It's easy to be negative about these things.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_037.wav|1|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_252.wav|12|I just saw them for a few minutes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_218.wav|29|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p225/p225_325.wav|101|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_139.wav|71|"I think he's the favourite, no question."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_322.wav|22|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_109.wav|91|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_034.wav|19|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_186.wav|97|Aye, but who do you really support?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_250.wav|26|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_318.wav|97|In fact, it might just be beginning.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_312.wav|35|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_038.wav|107|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_353.wav|36|I think this proposal is excellent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_239.wav|56|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_115.wav|71|"Here, again, they were denied a voice."
DUMMY2/p248/p248_281.wav|99|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_227.wav|64|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_072.wav|25|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_138.wav|11|It was the only possible decision.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_290.wav|86|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_266.wav|96|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_078.wav|29|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_146.wav|75|He could do nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_035.wav|59|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_220.wav|48|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_102.wav|72|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_404.wav|95|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_264.wav|88|Do you mean today?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_008.wav|18|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_184.wav|7|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_139.wav|61|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_230.wav|70|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_363.wav|22|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_143.wav|59|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_014.wav|90|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_402.wav|35|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_165.wav|89|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_013.wav|99|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_194.wav|69|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_239.wav|68|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_130.wav|72|You would be a fool not to listen.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_364.wav|1|This was another video cassette.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_168.wav|97|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_163.wav|60|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_448.wav|106|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_014.wav|99|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_020.wav|44|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_332.wav|22|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_120.wav|46|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_089.wav|36|IT is called a killing in the trade.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_004.wav|7|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p236/p236_135.wav|75|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_259.wav|35|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_293.wav|98|There was no secrecy.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_189.wav|20|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_233.wav|36|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_137.wav|8|The first half was depressing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_291.wav|32|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_179.wav|100|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_127.wav|39|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_030.wav|60|That depends on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_290.wav|69|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_247.wav|13|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_277.wav|26|They were all in a stable condition last night.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_173.wav|97|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_068.wav|58|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_204.wav|57|Is that success ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_296.wav|90|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_423.wav|36|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_272.wav|9|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_272.wav|86|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_242.wav|77|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_225.wav|92|Parole is a decision for me.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_098.wav|91|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_029.wav|7|He has the courage of the unaware.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_380.wav|92|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_338.wav|94|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_138.wav|73|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_213.wav|30|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_140.wav|30|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_044.wav|9|We will push.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_308.wav|58|We're all in a state of shock.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_025.wav|54|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_036.wav|63|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_103.wav|29|It was never a starter.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_414.wav|75|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_156.wav|43|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_349.wav|10|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_044.wav|76|We have not had a formal request.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_312.wav|10|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_317.wav|97|He urged people to forgive.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_092.wav|59|He's a star.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_099.wav|23|They must put them back.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_094.wav|83|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_198.wav|32|Everyone can have their opinion.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_057.wav|52|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_030.wav|81|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_027.wav|33|I have not seen the term immediate.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_419.wav|13|But a surprise is in store.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_214.wav|38|The approval system will be changed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_019.wav|7|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_278.wav|25|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_195.wav|56|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_156.wav|95|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_388.wav|98|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_212.wav|33|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_174.wav|66|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_067.wav|53|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_315.wav|41|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_194.wav|22|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_073.wav|72|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_488.wav|48|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_294.wav|14|It was never a free kick.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_126.wav|65|An announcement is expected within a few months.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_110.wav|4|It is not really used by many people.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_371.wav|74|He was not entirely correct.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_174.wav|57|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_347.wav|87|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_017.wav|89|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_150.wav|72|It will be easier for us.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_360.wav|97|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_078.wav|55|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_150.wav|45|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_064.wav|80|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_173.wav|4|This is a very interesting move.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_187.wav|106|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_341.wav|93|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_108.wav|8|We deserve a significant rise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_334.wav|89|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_229.wav|53|I want to see as much progress as possible.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_119.wav|28|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_270.wav|4|He said he was delighted by the award.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_308.wav|42|I can understand why they have gone.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_042.wav|98|I should say so.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_224.wav|87|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_175.wav|59|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_406.wav|105|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_405.wav|103|They've been here before.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_087.wav|3|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_093.wav|45|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_241.wav|37|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_241.wav|96|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_114.wav|4|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_165.wav|35|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_001.wav|1|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_120.wav|65|It came a bit late.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_120.wav|32|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_358.wav|74|The time was right.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_220.wav|84|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_404.wav|62|If so, they were wrong.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_035.wav|49|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_366.wav|17|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_066.wav|16|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_143.wav|95|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_229.wav|20|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_047.wav|40|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_037.wav|54|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_062.wav|34|This is the place to play football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_262.wav|93|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_343.wav|7|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_167.wav|81|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_294.wav|21|He had a decision to make.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_165.wav|60|We're very unhappy about it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_397.wav|77|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_105.wav|60|I am looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_060.wav|99|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_208.wav|84|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_014.wav|68|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_267.wav|67|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_408.wav|40|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_269.wav|7|What form did that take ?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_089.wav|107|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_114.wav|61|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_108.wav|83|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_287.wav|51|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_180.wav|78|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_220.wav|72|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_326.wav|56|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_106.wav|62|The Rangers think they have problems.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_165.wav|8|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_343.wav|11|It's a great idea.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_172.wav|79|It is a very demanding course.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_053.wav|35|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_063.wav|83|It happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_325.wav|28|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_131.wav|53|He's got to look after himself now.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_010.wav|92|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_064.wav|56|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_121.wav|35|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_119.wav|104|We have now no choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_423.wav|40|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_197.wav|24|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_237.wav|56|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_132.wav|35|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_116.wav|23|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_164.wav|27|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_265.wav|13|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_196.wav|32|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_046.wav|50|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_114.wav|56|We would make a start.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_053.wav|47|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_277.wav|88|And now he has decided, enough.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_298.wav|25|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_336.wav|74|I think we have got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_363.wav|99|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_389.wav|17|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_210.wav|54|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_150.wav|74|He is advised that he has done so.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_042.wav|78|And they had a case.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_243.wav|79|It's a technical demand.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_306.wav|53|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_121.wav|44|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_238.wav|26|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_061.wav|56|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_002.wav|82|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_250.wav|98|That does not mean we have failed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_292.wav|42|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_343.wav|95|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_331.wav|1|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_114.wav|10|I didn't think so either.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_003.wav|97|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_110.wav|13|There could still be some to come forward.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_226.wav|52|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_280.wav|82|We can build on that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_245.wav|1|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_233.wav|45|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_011.wav|82|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_281.wav|18|I think it has worked.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_126.wav|53|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_339.wav|5|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_175.wav|85|I have never seen him like that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_219.wav|27|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_421.wav|39|Today, the story is different.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_126.wav|42|Which brings us to the question of money.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_262.wav|83|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_050.wav|5|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_325.wav|44|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_001.wav|16|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_022.wav|53|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_268.wav|16|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_102.wav|74|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_358.wav|10|A crucial moment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_044.wav|106|This is slightly negative for inflation.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_045.wav|18|he told a producer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_164.wav|15|It was his greatest movie performance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_273.wav|87|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_142.wav|87|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_093.wav|21|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_214.wav|90|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_088.wav|94|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_335.wav|93|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_201.wav|100|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_364.wav|49|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_303.wav|61|Who can predict ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_093.wav|27|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_124.wav|46|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_345.wav|11|I have been struggling with my form.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_409.wav|50|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_088.wav|62|Either system could have prevented the crash.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_290.wav|91|Everything has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_025.wav|5|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_317.wav|20|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_421.wav|54|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_076.wav|23|More than half of the school collapsed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_122.wav|35|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_421.wav|56|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_165.wav|95|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_193.wav|52|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_328.wav|69|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_415.wav|17|The film is about the cost of genius.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_409.wav|76|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_303.wav|12|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_283.wav|57|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_150.wav|70|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_226.wav|49|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_294.wav|76|That, though, is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_254.wav|8|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_483.wav|48|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_011.wav|56|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_350.wav|53|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_165.wav|34|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_032.wav|69|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_272.wav|25|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_249.wav|76|We should be rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_103.wav|23|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_010.wav|63|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_069.wav|74|We were very close.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_072.wav|90|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_413.wav|65|Williams said the same.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_109.wav|80|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_044.wav|54|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_148.wav|42|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_064.wav|23|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_112.wav|63|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_304.wav|52|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_151.wav|40|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_186.wav|45|That would be my view.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_207.wav|75|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_326.wav|43|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_370.wav|13|And how he kept his word.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_249.wav|97|Just get on with your job.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_338.wav|44|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_222.wav|38|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_346.wav|98|He wouldn't do it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_228.wav|45|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_290.wav|104|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_042.wav|35|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_402.wav|0|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_122.wav|61|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_209.wav|4|There has also been some Scots input.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_324.wav|18|The number never came.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_190.wav|60|What could we do?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_078.wav|1|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_139.wav|48|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_126.wav|35|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_278.wav|36|For him then it's a labour of love.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_272.wav|42|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_004.wav|18|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_046.wav|35|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_216.wav|17|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_171.wav|35|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_136.wav|64|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_040.wav|96|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_133.wav|62|She was extremely rigid.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_168.wav|47|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_281.wav|40|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_264.wav|60|I don't intend to do so now.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_432.wav|37|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_064.wav|37|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_025.wav|61|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_165.wav|24|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_056.wav|43|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_092.wav|69|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_276.wav|15|That's a very serious matter.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_278.wav|48|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_155.wav|106|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_348.wav|14|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_154.wav|28|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_108.wav|3|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_285.wav|49|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_378.wav|0|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_150.wav|38|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_399.wav|23|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_098.wav|23|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_115.wav|44|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_281.wav|17|THE atmosphere was electric.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_366.wav|16|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_132.wav|63|They will remember this victory for a while.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_062.wav|23|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_119.wav|70|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_078.wav|58|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_194.wav|94|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_302.wav|35|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_288.wav|83|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_215.wav|98|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_255.wav|94|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_392.wav|42|This is the real thing now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_181.wav|22|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_229.wav|21|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_325.wav|76|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_074.wav|50|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_200.wav|22|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_199.wav|29|He made no order on costs.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_295.wav|18|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_396.wav|25|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_192.wav|38|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_034.wav|45|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_414.wav|39|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_271.wav|88|Last season was very hard for me.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_149.wav|87|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_414.wav|74|It means a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_119.wav|50|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_228.wav|40|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_302.wav|6|It was not the right time for me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_492.wav|24|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_137.wav|103|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_357.wav|51|I like what has happened!
DUMMY2/p334/p334_168.wav|38|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_388.wav|68|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_288.wav|44|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_112.wav|42|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_101.wav|12|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_236.wav|73|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_276.wav|16|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_387.wav|24|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_181.wav|60|We are really impressed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_166.wav|22|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_197.wav|73|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_192.wav|96|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_268.wav|38|I may think about performing it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_028.wav|92|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_378.wav|29|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_390.wav|67|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_376.wav|102|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_117.wav|93|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_122.wav|71|"Death is outside the language."
DUMMY2/p318/p318_248.wav|19|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_061.wav|14|What do we do ?)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_109.wav|32|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_367.wav|50|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_194.wav|104|You can't get a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_067.wav|77|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_032.wav|96|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_068.wav|66|Where is the human rights?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_179.wav|103|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_325.wav|7|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_388.wav|102|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_054.wav|22|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_179.wav|84|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_279.wav|53|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_239.wav|80|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_233.wav|39|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_271.wav|13|The company reacted very, very well.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_239.wav|91|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_296.wav|70|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_400.wav|37|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_094.wav|48|But I had never been in a theatre.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_246.wav|19|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_176.wav|35|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_047.wav|100|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_105.wav|65|It would be easy to think so.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_438.wav|8|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_187.wav|25|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_158.wav|8|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_314.wav|13|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_109.wav|22|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_168.wav|68|Can they be serious?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_152.wav|48|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_091.wav|0|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_374.wav|33|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_115.wav|54|Each day is a new beginning.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_123.wav|0|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_336.wav|17|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_404.wav|34|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_105.wav|35|It is close to call.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_357.wav|28|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_073.wav|69|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_126.wav|95|It was won on the issue of the land.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_348.wav|102|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_079.wav|60|The voters rejected us.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_123.wav|25|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_100.wav|25|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_060.wav|28|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_174.wav|21|That began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_187.wav|11|I know nothing about that.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_107.wav|44|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_068.wav|7|It is a job creation scheme.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_130.wav|85|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_260.wav|42|I'm the one who has to suffer.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_168.wav|55|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_216.wav|58|They were both very brave.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_099.wav|76|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_353.wav|0|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_265.wav|62|I said How much?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_267.wav|18|That's the important thing.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_226.wav|1|We're going to see more extreme weather.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_315.wav|28|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_093.wav|96|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_313.wav|72|It added to the reverence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_327.wav|102|It may also be her last.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_207.wav|99|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_128.wav|64|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_301.wav|91|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_401.wav|79|It was cynical and callous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_197.wav|63|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_303.wav|7|We're trying to get rounded performers.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_061.wav|26|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_382.wav|36|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_037.wav|20|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_153.wav|71|"It was deployed in the Gulf War."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_122.wav|15|I got the surprise of my life.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_236.wav|106|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_009.wav|37|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_008.wav|91|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_152.wav|25|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_274.wav|35|We feel very good about it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_239.wav|76|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_007.wav|45|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_072.wav|44|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_222.wav|32|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_418.wav|34|We tend to come good at the end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_398.wav|26|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_177.wav|43|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_237.wav|107|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_458.wav|36|Both promotions come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_222.wav|22|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p294/p294_173.wav|104|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_407.wav|49|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_084.wav|11|There is no question of dithering.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_337.wav|12|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_325.wav|69|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_260.wav|21|And they are different.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_251.wav|9|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_224.wav|48|But it's an enjoyable job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_293.wav|15|There are other things going on.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_099.wav|72|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_017.wav|98|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_277.wav|64|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_185.wav|3|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_400.wav|107|The Master was by then just too old.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_256.wav|17|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_130.wav|46|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_310.wav|82|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_059.wav|80|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_181.wav|21|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_050.wav|44|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_115.wav|78|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_211.wav|4|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_178.wav|2|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_082.wav|25|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_273.wav|27|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_218.wav|47|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_099.wav|100|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_296.wav|102|After that he became more romantic.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_157.wav|17|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_144.wav|56|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_108.wav|23|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_376.wav|8|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_079.wav|73|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_359.wav|79|So far, it is no more.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_148.wav|93|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_263.wav|92|It was seriously unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_129.wav|61|She really suffered for her art.

DUMMY2/p286/p286_356.wav|63|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_229.wav|89|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_217.wav|22|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_401.wav|69|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_384.wav|34|The idea has potential for the future.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_264.wav|101|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_167.wav|67|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_013.wav|11|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_156.wav|53|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_432.wav|75|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_391.wav|37|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_303.wav|57|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_325.wav|96|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_128.wav|82|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_013.wav|93|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_007.wav|25|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_401.wav|98|Are you all right?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_189.wav|42|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_090.wav|2|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_160.wav|102|She collapsed and died a day later.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_043.wav|7|Several investments have already been made.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_376.wav|45|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_276.wav|2|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_103.wav|34|He could look after himself, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_233.wav|54|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_383.wav|37|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_259.wav|61|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_009.wav|5|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_183.wav|97|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_159.wav|34|I got off to a great start.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_030.wav|73|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_272.wav|26|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_413.wav|75|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_116.wav|41|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_264.wav|54|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_296.wav|72|It makes no sense.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_138.wav|58|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_273.wav|73|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_192.wav|46|My ambitions are still with football.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_099.wav|35|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_298.wav|57|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_151.wav|31|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_030.wav|83|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_284.wav|60|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_299.wav|14|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_371.wav|23|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_006.wav|56|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_136.wav|90|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_156.wav|100|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_436.wav|27|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_244.wav|41|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_225.wav|34|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_171.wav|89|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_459.wav|100|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_105.wav|75|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_025.wav|8|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_318.wav|12|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_333.wav|48|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_143.wav|103|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_023.wav|2|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_097.wav|17|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_269.wav|107|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_273.wav|31|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_250.wav|54|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_265.wav|78|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_344.wav|52|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_385.wav|42|One might think that is a power.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_311.wav|55|Many events are down on numbers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_349.wav|31|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_230.wav|69|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_295.wav|15|So who is right?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_102.wav|38|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_074.wav|12|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_302.wav|56|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_210.wav|90|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_164.wav|1|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_041.wav|80|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_248.wav|14|Three weeks later, he resigned.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_248.wav|37|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_001.wav|45|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_113.wav|85|I've tried to get on with my life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_365.wav|6|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_381.wav|70|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_135.wav|10|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_175.wav|18|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_259.wav|28|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_152.wav|21|It always had to be about the gym.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_099.wav|29|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_168.wav|12|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_270.wav|106|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_215.wav|57|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_126.wav|74|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_342.wav|11|So what is their secret?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_313.wav|21|The children continue to talk to us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_080.wav|98|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_067.wav|94|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_165.wav|46|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_389.wav|78|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_067.wav|80|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_073.wav|51|You can't go on forever.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_085.wav|36|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_271.wav|94|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_265.wav|89|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_128.wav|75|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_096.wav|24|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_388.wav|6|I am enjoying it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_332.wav|53|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_009.wav|95|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_345.wav|29|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_197.wav|22|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_280.wav|21|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_036.wav|55|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_382.wav|20|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_409.wav|74|It will not be easy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_409.wav|52|The play was to go straight ahead.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_123.wav|44|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_285.wav|88|I certainly hope so.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_317.wav|69|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_278.wav|2|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_372.wav|91|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_178.wav|35|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_087.wav|87|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_020.wav|15|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_365.wav|101|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_045.wav|55|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_218.wav|56|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_386.wav|45|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_105.wav|105|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_329.wav|28|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_049.wav|37|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_056.wav|97|That tells you something about them.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_033.wav|11|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_248.wav|73|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_424.wav|34|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_406.wav|78|There is a demand for it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_449.wav|7|None of the pieces was commissioned.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_259.wav|23|I find the whole affair disturbing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_134.wav|60|And this game is all about belief.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_216.wav|4|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_057.wav|81|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_144.wav|30|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_034.wav|22|I kept my side of the bargain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_018.wav|104|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_037.wav|0|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_167.wav|36|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_320.wav|48|I have been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_196.wav|12|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_212.wav|17|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_011.wav|16|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_378.wav|38|Here we have not had one hour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_336.wav|22|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_019.wav|66|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_121.wav|32|That is far too high.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_312.wav|76|I'm not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_376.wav|104|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_188.wav|24|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_395.wav|74|It wasn't the second one.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_026.wav|65|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_171.wav|15|Do we want to see it?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_194.wav|56|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_019.wav|17|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_296.wav|60|I believe it will happen.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_284.wav|19|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_256.wav|20|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_238.wav|88|We just do not do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_008.wav|83|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_056.wav|80|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_194.wav|14|They were seriously after him.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_107.wav|79|Music is all consuming.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_080.wav|46|No-one said anything to me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_091.wav|46|This is my life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_091.wav|89|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p252/p252_104.wav|55|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_015.wav|75|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_132.wav|22|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_357.wav|39|The pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_275.wav|22|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_213.wav|102|It is like being a qualifier again.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_050.wav|20|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_316.wav|80|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_355.wav|74|I just did not cope with the pressure.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_133.wav|94|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_219.wav|80|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_281.wav|33|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.

DUMMY2/p345/p345_107.wav|82|I was going to help with the dinner.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_085.wav|9|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_264.wav|43|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_075.wav|92|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_466.wav|48|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_371.wav|15|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_256.wav|27|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_133.wav|46|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_071.wav|105|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_018.wav|6|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_072.wav|106|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_276.wav|38|This is a lie.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_188.wav|47|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_119.wav|65|Trading is tough at the moment.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_046.wav|74|It would be another reason to live.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_110.wav|27|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_267.wav|57|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_185.wav|55|Maybe this battle had been.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_018.wav|71|"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "
DUMMY2/p361/p361_343.wav|79|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_031.wav|107|It has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_208.wav|77|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_383.wav|75|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_413.wav|35|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_307.wav|93|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_180.wav|60|I could easy do that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_266.wav|65|Everyone wanted him to win.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_347.wav|105|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_320.wav|19|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_252.wav|82|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_332.wav|65|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_091.wav|42|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_163.wav|3|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_399.wav|105|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_241.wav|84|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_346.wav|89|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_058.wav|93|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_084.wav|33|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_086.wav|16|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_348.wav|32|There was some merit in that.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_010.wav|5|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_393.wav|33|The research was my life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_319.wav|74|One is investment, one is reform.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_015.wav|20|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_024.wav|76|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_022.wav|97|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_106.wav|94|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_034.wav|10|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_177.wav|65|Once again, he refused.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_353.wav|69|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_266.wav|48|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_105.wav|21|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_314.wav|33|There is good quality.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_210.wav|6|I wanted to have a go.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_066.wav|58|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_188.wav|27|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_138.wav|15|He has created the confusion.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_374.wav|18|It shows the Government is listening.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_362.wav|52|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_402.wav|10|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_161.wav|85|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_147.wav|35|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_381.wav|77|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_373.wav|97|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_260.wav|104|I haven't a clue.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_251.wav|51|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_156.wav|28|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_396.wav|76|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_081.wav|42|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_075.wav|19|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_043.wav|87|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_373.wav|34|PR will be just one of them.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_371.wav|70|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_004.wav|39|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_164.wav|80|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_295.wav|50|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_137.wav|10|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_246.wav|35|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_140.wav|97|Actors stand still in the frame.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_005.wav|93|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_131.wav|11|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_220.wav|103|Four people died instantly.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_148.wav|99|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_258.wav|53|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_382.wav|45|It would be a massive boost for them.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_247.wav|106|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_265.wav|10|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_132.wav|106|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_350.wav|21|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_311.wav|80|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_267.wav|1|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_222.wav|33|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_258.wav|33|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_207.wav|45|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_245.wav|33|Haven't been so lucky since.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_165.wav|55|They have shown great character.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_101.wav|32|Our house was very small.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_240.wav|105|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_081.wav|11|and their remit is limited.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_183.wav|86|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_177.wav|87|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_167.wav|56|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_395.wav|34|He already had had complaints.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_164.wav|11|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_288.wav|63|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_415.wav|0|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_119.wav|13|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_465.wav|14|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_161.wav|103|It will be a great night.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_216.wav|9|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_106.wav|74|He didn't bother a soul.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_119.wav|31|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_293.wav|0|We have a plan in place.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_249.wav|105|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_185.wav|33|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_297.wav|12|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_390.wav|104|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_071.wav|55|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_049.wav|104|We've all done it!
DUMMY2/p269/p269_072.wav|94|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_002.wav|8|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_120.wav|60|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_117.wav|89|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_135.wav|23|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_106.wav|64|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_065.wav|104|People remember the Tories in office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_319.wav|6|That would be the constructive way forward.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_302.wav|22|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_247.wav|3|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_233.wav|65|It was a great evening.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_389.wav|67|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_187.wav|15|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_006.wav|36|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_105.wav|1|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_376.wav|28|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_335.wav|52|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_349.wav|57|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_196.wav|97|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_417.wav|103|It is so elusive and light.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_024.wav|86|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_101.wav|70|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_303.wav|15|We have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_254.wav|7|The body follows the mind.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_115.wav|46|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_138.wav|46|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_417.wav|22|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_299.wav|94|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_063.wav|42|Nobody can get at them there.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_092.wav|52|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_395.wav|91|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_128.wav|37|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_169.wav|15|I always wanted her to be happy.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_195.wav|83|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_387.wav|29|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_012.wav|21|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_220.wav|20|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_244.wav|25|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_012.wav|84|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_058.wav|88|That's where it all started.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_256.wav|42|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_368.wav|104|He found it very hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_184.wav|89|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_179.wav|37|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_343.wav|9|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_128.wav|47|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_316.wav|87|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_149.wav|46|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_067.wav|33|We can't go home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_313.wav|41|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_342.wav|14|It is inherent in society.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_281.wav|75|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_052.wav|96|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_153.wav|0|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_002.wav|62|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_277.wav|58|Is this new report the answer?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_377.wav|84|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_099.wav|7|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_380.wav|29|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_242.wav|97|They were even being used by primary pupils.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_286.wav|77|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_391.wav|53|My tax affairs have been totally open.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_253.wav|54|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_350.wav|78|This isn't the end of story.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_375.wav|11|The mood was euphoric.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_022.wav|74|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_374.wav|52|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_042.wav|49|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_033.wav|101|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_234.wav|26|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_001.wav|77|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_035.wav|79|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_181.wav|81|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_106.wav|35|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_270.wav|45|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_311.wav|86|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_253.wav|81|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_308.wav|28|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_120.wav|7|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_269.wav|29|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_277.wav|1|The film has also been superbly designed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_255.wav|77|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_017.wav|86|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_016.wav|46|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_149.wav|45|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_289.wav|27|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_072.wav|96|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_008.wav|101|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_076.wav|54|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_356.wav|40|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_282.wav|79|Indeed, that has already begun.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_192.wav|63|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_074.wav|25|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_151.wav|18|We were extremely lucky.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_013.wav|87|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_164.wav|85|We did not deserve to go through.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_368.wav|9|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_382.wav|68|We are being hijacked.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_197.wav|38|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_180.wav|83|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_065.wav|54|I am a drug addict.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_366.wav|52|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_155.wav|44|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_282.wav|94|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_081.wav|40|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_302.wav|104|Everything is so commercial.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_104.wav|53|They won't actually make any money from it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_386.wav|87|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_220.wav|85|We need a much wider debate.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_050.wav|66|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_371.wav|64|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_129.wav|66|It ended as it began, in confusion.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_076.wav|66|But there was a shift.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_030.wav|16|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_102.wav|47|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_021.wav|76|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_068.wav|44|Some people still think she should be English.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_052.wav|64|This is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_130.wav|34|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_379.wav|62|Stand by for action.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_202.wav|19|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_139.wav|92|That, however, is the end of the good news.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_365.wav|105|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_323.wav|69|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_129.wav|55|We beat the Welsh team.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_248.wav|4|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_069.wav|69|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_145.wav|23|The same goes for McKenna.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_038.wav|50|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_406.wav|72|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_175.wav|67|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_336.wav|32|And he goes with it.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_273.wav|49|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_403.wav|42|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_347.wav|3|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_106.wav|2|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_278.wav|11|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_423.wav|37|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_006.wav|12|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_421.wav|6|It could have taken another two months.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_205.wav|5|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_202.wav|76|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_278.wav|37|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_239.wav|51|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_290.wav|11|He's very good at relating to adults.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_252.wav|95|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_086.wav|46|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_158.wav|3|The players were under pressure.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_406.wav|26|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_368.wav|107|But it may not be all bad news.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_198.wav|11|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_381.wav|72|She failed to win any of them.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_121.wav|12|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_002.wav|107|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_069.wav|80|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_329.wav|55|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_033.wav|39|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_094.wav|31|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_300.wav|83|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_362.wav|102|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_331.wav|78|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_455.wav|89|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_039.wav|49|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_315.wav|11|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_188.wav|12|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_238.wav|43|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_222.wav|68|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_369.wav|45|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_161.wav|99|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_405.wav|36|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_382.wav|16|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_028.wav|37|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_070.wav|42|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_302.wav|52|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_304.wav|17|That would have been too easy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_389.wav|53|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_054.wav|41|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_010.wav|9|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_075.wav|39|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_226.wav|45|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_364.wav|40|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_274.wav|48|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_125.wav|44|I asked why he had come.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_115.wav|56|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_036.wav|39|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_375.wav|62|It was a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_083.wav|38|This must be really short of ideas.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_214.wav|11|I thought their commitment was superb.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_265.wav|14|Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_202.wav|26|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_089.wav|75|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_046.wav|85|They were taken to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_336.wav|13|I've never had problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_120.wav|103|They don't have to, but they normally do.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_260.wav|10|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_385.wav|58|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_117.wav|43|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_399.wav|72|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_125.wav|42|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_388.wav|14|It benefits the whole family.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_101.wav|26|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_103.wav|98|This is not finished.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_418.wav|65|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_173.wav|58|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_220.wav|18|However, he added there were signs of progress.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_087.wav|46|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_102.wav|16|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_084.wav|69|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_404.wav|42|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_056.wav|56|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_012.wav|69|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_438.wav|7|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_271.wav|11|Three months or so later, they are returning.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_178.wav|10|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_141.wav|86|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_133.wav|53|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_285.wav|41|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_140.wav|1|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_125.wav|61|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_016.wav|63|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_327.wav|96|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_085.wav|40|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_101.wav|56|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_318.wav|13|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_177.wav|68|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_252.wav|5|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_073.wav|46|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_229.wav|7|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_033.wav|38|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_447.wav|24|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_104.wav|34|The decision was designed to shock investors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_344.wav|48|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_259.wav|103|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_029.wav|78|It is about investing in the future.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_230.wav|15|He has every right to do that.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_167.wav|39|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_350.wav|16|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_053.wav|22|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_008.wav|20|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_211.wav|55|Their bodies were never found.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_084.wav|74|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_017.wav|34|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_134.wav|27|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_002.wav|6|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_106.wav|31|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_194.wav|98|Where do you think she is going?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_225.wav|53|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_069.wav|10|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_162.wav|17|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_058.wav|57|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_360.wav|76|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_356.wav|3|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_153.wav|11|But opinion was divided.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_121.wav|100|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_055.wav|2|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_393.wav|36|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_003.wav|74|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_269.wav|25|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_040.wav|77|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_339.wav|0|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_113.wav|18|Sometimes they come off.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_179.wav|24|You will be very welcome.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_100.wav|104|You should have let it write the cards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_281.wav|95|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_144.wav|54|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_380.wav|50|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_404.wav|24|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_351.wav|89|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_390.wav|4|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_163.wav|31|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_278.wav|79|Here we go then.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_338.wav|41|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_409.wav|26|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_203.wav|43|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_012.wav|100|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_104.wav|78|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_448.wav|37|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_014.wav|105|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_103.wav|5|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_027.wav|31|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_107.wav|61|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_197.wav|87|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_011.wav|96|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_346.wav|27|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_272.wav|1|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_088.wav|67|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_174.wav|33|But is that possible?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_228.wav|103|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_155.wav|78|It was all for good reason as well.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_242.wav|49|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_357.wav|89|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_287.wav|24|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_279.wav|29|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_302.wav|57|Is there on his hands ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_370.wav|47|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_273.wav|36|England could only play the other team on the park.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_163.wav|37|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_268.wav|45|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_322.wav|54|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_205.wav|71|"That is an important part of our role."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_355.wav|10|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_292.wav|85|We deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_177.wav|54|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_405.wav|8|Ferguson must take the blame.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_288.wav|18|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_004.wav|25|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_397.wav|38|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_076.wav|48|The Government does not go far enough.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_334.wav|38|The plot is simple.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_317.wav|54|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_217.wav|48|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_275.wav|82|Anyone else can apply.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_294.wav|45|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_123.wav|51|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_101.wav|49|I like what has happened!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_170.wav|58|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_391.wav|51|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_363.wav|75|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_306.wav|104|The order went out.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_086.wav|22|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_118.wav|6|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_182.wav|15|England will be quite prepared.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_254.wav|74|Let's make this clear.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_168.wav|102|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_335.wav|70|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_239.wav|25|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_298.wav|61|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_171.wav|28|Tourism continues to struggle.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_065.wav|51|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_112.wav|48|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_261.wav|27|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_206.wav|10|We could soon be in that same position!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_183.wav|31|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_253.wav|41|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_004.wav|96|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_007.wav|95|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_104.wav|105|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_320.wav|5|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_293.wav|75|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_124.wav|1|Repayment is not part of the game.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_029.wav|95|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_089.wav|95|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_315.wav|55|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_031.wav|92|Which is where the manager comes in.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_255.wav|50|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_091.wav|55|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_348.wav|81|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_056.wav|48|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_401.wav|68|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_368.wav|84|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_143.wav|64|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_207.wav|94|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_203.wav|31|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_280.wav|68|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_350.wav|57|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_395.wav|96|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_231.wav|2|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_302.wav|97|The failings are serious.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_015.wav|8|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_240.wav|94|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_369.wav|0|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_371.wav|41|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_103.wav|42|However, what is his calibre?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_111.wav|70|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_246.wav|76|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_128.wav|54|Who is the employer?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_188.wav|41|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_052.wav|47|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_075.wav|107|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_024.wav|25|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_119.wav|54|A lot of things can go wrong.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_210.wav|16|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_243.wav|0|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_192.wav|49|That wasn't for me.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_190.wav|103|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_322.wav|28|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_236.wav|88|Thankfully they liked it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_311.wav|107|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_010.wav|64|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_109.wav|35|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_368.wav|10|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_095.wav|1|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_243.wav|91|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_265.wav|15|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_184.wav|19|He quit in October.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_335.wav|87|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_021.wav|35|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_083.wav|72|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_268.wav|11|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_200.wav|14|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_384.wav|8|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_085.wav|39|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_096.wav|48|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_378.wav|104|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_291.wav|22|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_327.wav|18|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_040.wav|12|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_201.wav|23|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_250.wav|25|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_047.wav|19|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_118.wav|79|We couldn't get enough of it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_245.wav|55|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_212.wav|35|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_356.wav|11|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_124.wav|32|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_377.wav|82|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_315.wav|79|They are already there.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_345.wav|33|It will carry on.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_228.wav|66|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_155.wav|64|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_038.wav|37|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_003.wav|2|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_055.wav|61|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_180.wav|79|I could have been offended.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_258.wav|106|I felt we deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_450.wav|75|We are going for it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_296.wav|52|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_037.wav|66|This has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_149.wav|97|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_429.wav|95|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_275.wav|0|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_059.wav|25|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_105.wav|17|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_350.wav|103|I just had so much fun.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_377.wav|8|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_469.wav|75|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_001.wav|68|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_279.wav|103|That's a very strong element.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_319.wav|45|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_004.wav|11|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_471.wav|95|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_213.wav|41|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_042.wav|25|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_328.wav|79|It's all about unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_407.wav|98|It would be that absurd.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_309.wav|25|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_311.wav|46|I think that could work to our advantage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_220.wav|0|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_016.wav|81|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_001.wav|54|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_106.wav|90|Get to know him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_008.wav|32|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p249/p249_021.wav|80|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_117.wav|49|Police were also perplexed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_209.wav|8|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_220.wav|54|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_241.wav|1|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_006.wav|51|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_260.wav|79|Was he confident about his prospects?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_168.wav|13|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_061.wav|92|I just have no maternal instincts.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_178.wav|61|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_141.wav|20|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_130.wav|48|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_021.wav|70|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_058.wav|39|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_170.wav|74|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_382.wav|35|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_064.wav|40|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_127.wav|107|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_251.wav|83|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_098.wav|11|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_276.wav|81|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_127.wav|62|What's wrong with that?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_128.wav|31|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_405.wav|40|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_233.wav|67|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_178.wav|75|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_149.wav|18|It was so sad.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_218.wav|5|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_243.wav|86|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_077.wav|44|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_322.wav|72|I think it is wide open.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_211.wav|71|"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_117.wav|3|And we had a good response.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_169.wav|11|That's the kind of production it was.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_267.wav|21|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_420.wav|100|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_268.wav|59|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_052.wav|11|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_356.wav|32|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_086.wav|84|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_093.wav|6|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_229.wav|16|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_243.wav|20|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_398.wav|78|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_301.wav|104|Their bid was a very good one.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_182.wav|65|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_040.wav|31|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_450.wav|8|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_308.wav|39|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_342.wav|62|That was the biggest game of my life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_326.wav|101|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_376.wav|82|It has not yet opened to pupils.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_332.wav|54|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_135.wav|29|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_440.wav|75|But by that time, it was too late.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_239.wav|8|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_218.wav|38|We are determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_443.wav|106|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_162.wav|106|A good actor doesn't think.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_061.wav|77|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_009.wav|18|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_110.wav|71|"It is rubbish."
DUMMY2/p269/p269_030.wav|94|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_342.wav|12|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_302.wav|95|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_146.wav|99|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_147.wav|31|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_188.wav|102|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_047.wav|76|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_012.wav|85|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_370.wav|77|The members have voted against it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_040.wav|75|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_232.wav|2|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_038.wav|3|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_164.wav|56|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_165.wav|72|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_419.wav|0|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_121.wav|57|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_427.wav|95|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_026.wav|1|I was backing him up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_352.wav|76|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_185.wav|73|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_115.wav|67|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_282.wav|82|We are not going to be complacent.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_085.wav|32|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_302.wav|93|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_040.wav|56|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_094.wav|91|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_312.wav|69|It will work.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_150.wav|41|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_208.wav|104|This club is perfect for me.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_337.wav|7|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_206.wav|50|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_038.wav|48|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_337.wav|70|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_262.wav|38|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_432.wav|89|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_307.wav|92|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_419.wav|19|I didn't play all that well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_122.wav|76|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_086.wav|52|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_459.wav|89|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_358.wav|26|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_091.wav|44|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_210.wav|3|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_173.wav|89|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_309.wav|42|They will give it a couple of years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_104.wav|9|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_355.wav|29|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_033.wav|49|But she was very human.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_296.wav|35|It took a month and a half to film.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_038.wav|99|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_001.wav|95|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_141.wav|97|Who honestly expected anything else?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_234.wav|53|The labour side has developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_153.wav|52|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_301.wav|82|It will be extremely difficult for him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_113.wav|50|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_349.wav|27|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_229.wav|107|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_386.wav|91|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_029.wav|0|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_103.wav|84|Police said the family was helping with the search.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_218.wav|52|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_325.wav|46|I haven't won the world title.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_353.wav|72|My life is in the ballet.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_134.wav|105|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_315.wav|57|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_193.wav|97|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_268.wav|39|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_257.wav|90|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_166.wav|52|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_214.wav|16|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_226.wav|28|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_224.wav|32|We have not given up hope.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_144.wav|73|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_194.wav|47|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_044.wav|69|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_134.wav|12|There is still much work to be done.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_125.wav|23|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_219.wav|85|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_124.wav|83|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_325.wav|17|There is no threat to them.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_331.wav|97|It is still with Ministers.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_146.wav|84|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_247.wav|21|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_110.wav|104|This has gone on too long.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_259.wav|71|"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_003.wav|34|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_321.wav|62|I wouldn't say this is normal.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_292.wav|22|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_119.wav|30|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_261.wav|21|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_020.wav|46|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_161.wav|89|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_063.wav|32|We need to increase the membership.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_135.wav|55|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_070.wav|25|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_367.wav|40|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_141.wav|27|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_145.wav|53|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_013.wav|9|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_172.wav|74|It is no more than a shell.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_389.wav|55|The women are victims here.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_172.wav|21|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_160.wav|81|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_036.wav|97|It was a policy they were against.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_061.wav|8|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_382.wav|64|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_446.wav|37|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_138.wav|22|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_118.wav|10|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_018.wav|84|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_015.wav|69|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_106.wav|22|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_019.wav|5|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_004.wav|42|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_327.wav|83|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_158.wav|17|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_207.wav|11|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_071.wav|73|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_020.wav|26|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_088.wav|20|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_277.wav|56|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_181.wav|70|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_409.wav|35|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_047.wav|36|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_357.wav|69|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_192.wav|47|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_399.wav|46|They were both very brave.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_275.wav|73|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_044.wav|41|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_053.wav|27|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_398.wav|7|The principle is quite clear.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_343.wav|87|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_065.wav|4|Only one got through.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_072.wav|102|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_284.wav|82|His body was found in May.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_246.wav|52|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_137.wav|95|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_048.wav|33|That is not the case.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_273.wav|48|I thought we were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_355.wav|22|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_372.wav|22|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_299.wav|68|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_319.wav|55|One finding emerged clearly.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_230.wav|39|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_325.wav|39|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_036.wav|45|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_048.wav|81|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_205.wav|26|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_090.wav|30|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_218.wav|27|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_381.wav|75|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_306.wav|86|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_184.wav|4|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_058.wav|63|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_070.wav|106|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_061.wav|30|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_221.wav|68|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_126.wav|46|We are in the business of selling tickets.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_250.wav|22|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_191.wav|20|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_263.wav|97|If only the problems concerned the players.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_080.wav|4|We've got a job to do.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_337.wav|87|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_063.wav|90|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_059.wav|39|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_167.wav|23|It's unfair on her.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_020.wav|92|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_076.wav|55|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_063.wav|14|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_157.wav|79|Something has to be put in place.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_225.wav|27|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_049.wav|24|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_044.wav|87|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_153.wav|4|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_156.wav|29|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_027.wav|90|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_418.wav|103|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_168.wav|2|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_154.wav|13|He also has property interests in the country.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_417.wav|51|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_419.wav|85|Audiences there were shocked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_347.wav|20|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_172.wav|50|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_028.wav|29|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_334.wav|3|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_296.wav|21|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_247.wav|78|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_128.wav|69|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_078.wav|20|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_296.wav|48|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_330.wav|35|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_366.wav|37|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_105.wav|11|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_363.wav|53|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_316.wav|53|A report on their property is due within days.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_087.wav|51|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_267.wav|61|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_328.wav|19|It went on to become an annual event.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_034.wav|70|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_184.wav|15|There is no conflict of interest.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_194.wav|93|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_006.wav|47|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_107.wav|50|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_198.wav|90|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_182.wav|88|We will see how he is.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_191.wav|87|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_101.wav|4|Johnsen is equally concerned.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_314.wav|81|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_112.wav|95|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_012.wav|4|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_357.wav|2|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_050.wav|42|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_237.wav|53|He has worked for several years in the United States.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_338.wav|80|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_349.wav|84|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_324.wav|89|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_137.wav|61|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_170.wav|16|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_366.wav|47|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_066.wav|23|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_293.wav|73|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_075.wav|68|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_265.wav|80|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_217.wav|88|It's happened, but it's a dream.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_370.wav|83|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_117.wav|23|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_359.wav|14|He said something in his work.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_075.wav|100|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_475.wav|24|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_044.wav|95|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_401.wav|87|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_309.wav|45|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_075.wav|11|I'd love to do another Olympics.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_361.wav|32|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_255.wav|32|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_133.wav|97|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_067.wav|31|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_258.wav|52|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_138.wav|65|It's very dangerous for markets.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_154.wav|59|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_367.wav|13|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_241.wav|34|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_411.wav|55|I'd like to report a murder.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_227.wav|97|It's unsafe for society.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_340.wav|77|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_038.wav|39|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_294.wav|10|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_173.wav|65|Art can challenge our value system.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_064.wav|19|I learned a lot from that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_086.wav|77|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_074.wav|24|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_125.wav|10|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_036.wav|71|"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_372.wav|77|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_376.wav|36|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_230.wav|100|A terrorist is a terrorist.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_296.wav|14|It's hard to see it.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_175.wav|34|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_167.wav|43|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_401.wav|47|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_037.wav|33|Both sides will be aware of this.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_288.wav|2|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_329.wav|103|I can't believe something like this could happen.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_376.wav|63|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_133.wav|8|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_291.wav|50|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_157.wav|67|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_376.wav|87|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_024.wav|29|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_389.wav|87|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_092.wav|61|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_076.wav|87|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_133.wav|19|I am sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_063.wav|19|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_416.wav|78|There is no need to panic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_258.wav|36|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_330.wav|65|I can't get away from it.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_185.wav|102|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_136.wav|69|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_152.wav|78|It starts at the top.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_239.wav|29|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_152.wav|51|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_187.wav|42|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_239.wav|23|She returned home a few days later.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_021.wav|10|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_208.wav|16|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_189.wav|45|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_085.wav|103|There are no excuses.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_278.wav|10|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_219.wav|39|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_403.wav|63|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_151.wav|29|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_199.wav|42|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_403.wav|39|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_119.wav|96|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_271.wav|69|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_314.wav|89|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_349.wav|92|No one wants to go through these things.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_383.wav|74|I hadn't had that before.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_185.wav|46|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_360.wav|36|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_406.wav|11|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_143.wav|60|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_061.wav|84|You have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_181.wav|61|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_403.wav|92|We wanted to run away with her.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_180.wav|99|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_288.wav|65|If not, a deal could take many months.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_179.wav|60|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_180.wav|3|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_070.wav|19|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_063.wav|16|They are real.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_025.wav|66|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_239.wav|84|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_295.wav|14|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_212.wav|76|But there's no eye contact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_422.wav|100|We're delighted about the vote.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_009.wav|12|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_225.wav|72|I see no reason for them to be.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_238.wav|107|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_364.wav|11|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_051.wav|80|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_373.wav|7|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_199.wav|1|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_211.wav|0|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_201.wav|0|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_003.wav|51|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_199.wav|50|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_243.wav|33|This is excellent news for the workforce.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_367.wav|32|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_360.wav|91|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_337.wav|106|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_039.wav|39|No company would want to put their people at risk.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_310.wav|55|Good players have become bad.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_075.wav|8|My immune system had been depleted.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_289.wav|74|It wasn't an easy decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_409.wav|27|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_039.wav|48|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_287.wav|4|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_334.wav|77|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_100.wav|31|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_034.wav|55|I have every confidence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_403.wav|104|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_301.wav|17|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_051.wav|101|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_125.wav|9|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_074.wav|98|Yet what is supposed to be said?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_237.wav|6|By then it was too late.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_247.wav|81|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_187.wav|13|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_347.wav|56|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_002.wav|26|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_415.wav|4|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_082.wav|70|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_326.wav|64|It's fantastic to have finally won.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_130.wav|11|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_253.wav|43|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_010.wav|49|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_217.wav|10|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_124.wav|65|The family moved around a lot.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_133.wav|4|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_411.wav|32|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_338.wav|26|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_379.wav|22|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_109.wav|18|It was all over now.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_051.wav|8|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_133.wav|51|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_031.wav|24|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_223.wav|70|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_157.wav|74|So we started building a home.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_230.wav|22|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_008.wav|30|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_162.wav|29|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_072.wav|93|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_410.wav|79|It has a rally instead of a conference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_257.wav|102|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_339.wav|19|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_379.wav|28|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_283.wav|94|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_061.wav|40|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_148.wav|41|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_032.wav|25|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_125.wav|25|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_277.wav|27|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_159.wav|54|He had worked there for only two days.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_321.wav|11|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_070.wav|104|I don't have any answer for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_300.wav|43|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_055.wav|90|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_086.wav|1|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_170.wav|88|It's all happening at a local level.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_187.wav|56|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_217.wav|15|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_260.wav|67|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_261.wav|30|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_181.wav|106|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_390.wav|51|It was early morning.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_124.wav|107|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_067.wav|96|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_241.wav|40|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_045.wav|41|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_059.wav|87|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_005.wav|2|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_093.wav|26|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_314.wav|31|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_113.wav|39|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_223.wav|0|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_051.wav|9|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_276.wav|45|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_033.wav|51|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_199.wav|86|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_001.wav|82|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_123.wav|3|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_251.wav|7|The scientific debate is dead.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_289.wav|32|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_209.wav|95|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_260.wav|48|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_038.wav|27|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_220.wav|33|He had worked there for only two days.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_167.wav|57|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_350.wav|92|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_383.wav|14|It's as wide as a church in here.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_198.wav|57|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_122.wav|77|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_365.wav|95|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_246.wav|46|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_283.wav|42|This is wrong, but that's believed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_127.wav|66|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_263.wav|106|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_246.wav|12|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_017.wav|32|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p376/p376_244.wav|71|"He said he intended to push for a judicial review."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_110.wav|20|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_273.wav|80|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_034.wav|31|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_127.wav|98|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_259.wav|93|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_311.wav|20|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_210.wav|105|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_194.wav|100|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_324.wav|11|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_151.wav|52|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_401.wav|17|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_146.wav|11|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_084.wav|95|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_333.wav|23|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_271.wav|107|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_235.wav|18|The answer is obviously no.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_098.wav|85|I will just have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_051.wav|50|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_262.wav|40|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_290.wav|75|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_133.wav|23|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_044.wav|32|People want to see me on the screen.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_231.wav|65|This is absolutely not true.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_283.wav|22|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_250.wav|55|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_003.wav|95|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_200.wav|82|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_146.wav|56|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_170.wav|4|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_142.wav|63|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_202.wav|14|Mr Blair was ready for him.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_180.wav|103|I love the moment of being first.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_341.wav|39|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_423.wav|65|This man must be helped to keep his arm.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_041.wav|49|I only half believed it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_198.wav|37|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_391.wav|6|Are these immoral?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_096.wav|19|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_130.wav|79|It will be released in October.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_208.wav|22|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_187.wav|30|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_291.wav|30|He is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_080.wav|3|On the night, it was not enough.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_146.wav|6|There's a lot of it going on.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_209.wav|17|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_019.wav|90|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_376.wav|64|You will not feel a thing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_354.wav|69|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_425.wav|7|It is hard to understand.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_078.wav|96|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_392.wav|64|It is not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_315.wav|14|His job was not advertised.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_267.wav|107|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_089.wav|13|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_101.wav|100|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_135.wav|79|It will have to ratify the deal.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_284.wav|37|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_128.wav|79|We've always had something to do.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_202.wav|50|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_393.wav|23|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_191.wav|0|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_126.wav|72|We are going to have a parade.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_313.wav|63|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_177.wav|81|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_292.wav|58|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_049.wav|40|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_299.wav|18|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_399.wav|63|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_126.wav|29|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_097.wav|35|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_189.wav|50|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_106.wav|78|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_122.wav|95|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_319.wav|38|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_293.wav|38|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_145.wav|20|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_227.wav|79|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_200.wav|67|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_116.wav|69|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_064.wav|14|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_111.wav|31|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_368.wav|97|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_289.wav|56|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_075.wav|73|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_218.wav|31|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_229.wav|80|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_284.wav|33|The rest, of course, is history.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_194.wav|30|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_316.wav|8|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_327.wav|6|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_095.wav|20|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_241.wav|90|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_147.wav|89|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_308.wav|97|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_460.wav|63|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_288.wav|102|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_034.wav|39|The idea is not new.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_342.wav|85|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_398.wav|105|I was very young.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_334.wav|64|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_453.wav|39|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_396.wav|38|The sun is worth a million dollars.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_389.wav|51|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_080.wav|83|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_002.wav|96|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_077.wav|89|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_034.wav|21|What can you do?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_019.wav|20|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_367.wav|26|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_149.wav|50|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_083.wav|37|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_185.wav|13|He had come of age.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_165.wav|64|His funeral is not expected until next week.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_196.wav|53|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_296.wav|22|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_123.wav|84|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_072.wav|84|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_022.wav|76|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_297.wav|98|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_126.wav|97|A decision is expected shortly.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_052.wav|97|Are we going to stay up?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_120.wav|23|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_275.wav|100|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_421.wav|79|My life is going to go on.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_212.wav|68|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_030.wav|87|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_225.wav|28|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_330.wav|103|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_319.wav|10|The answer was in space.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_333.wav|54|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p277/p277_440.wav|89|And it showed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_240.wav|86|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_117.wav|66|Both managements are very supportive.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_288.wav|50|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_304.wav|3|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_225.wav|99|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_277.wav|25|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_387.wav|8|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_159.wav|97|She is a double victim.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_055.wav|18|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_194.wav|61|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_265.wav|61|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_254.wav|27|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_306.wav|41|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_030.wav|34|This is the best way to do it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_357.wav|56|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_354.wav|41|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_130.wav|86|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_226.wav|55|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_387.wav|19|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_043.wav|13|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_271.wav|62|I'm not afraid of that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_363.wav|21|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_253.wav|73|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_048.wav|104|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_153.wav|97|They should be looking at his victims.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_161.wav|82|I have a great respect for her.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_225.wav|54|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_166.wav|8|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_412.wav|103|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_151.wav|8|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_245.wav|62|Why has it taken so long?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_144.wav|47|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_344.wav|67|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_347.wav|5|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_146.wav|48|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_011.wav|47|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_241.wav|83|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_101.wav|30|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_079.wav|87|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_331.wav|40|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_253.wav|3|It was just another play.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_115.wav|9|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_234.wav|0|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_162.wav|97|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_269.wav|106|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_344.wav|2|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_313.wav|47|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_121.wav|2|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_139.wav|45|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_144.wav|105|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_214.wav|29|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_111.wav|82|They were back in favour with the SAC.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_362.wav|11|It is almost like a family.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_403.wav|38|It was nerve-racking to watch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_096.wav|35|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_384.wav|70|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_424.wav|15|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_315.wav|27|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_124.wav|11|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_327.wav|4|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_237.wav|30|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_071.wav|102|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_332.wav|81|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_166.wav|68|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_154.wav|64|She is a valuable member of the Government.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_112.wav|102|There is great relief at this point.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_416.wav|19|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_040.wav|105|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_042.wav|32|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_187.wav|2|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_093.wav|9|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_249.wav|43|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_230.wav|21|You have a very persuasive president.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_205.wav|25|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_113.wav|86|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_113.wav|66|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_236.wav|41|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_106.wav|16|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_260.wav|105|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_067.wav|64|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_015.wav|40|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_348.wav|1|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_360.wav|33|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_115.wav|27|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_034.wav|78|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_012.wav|7|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_261.wav|31|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_165.wav|97|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_133.wav|38|It was a simple question.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_314.wav|14|Britain is going to celebrate in style.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_010.wav|75|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_191.wav|2|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_144.wav|97|They never looked like winning it either.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_313.wav|44|Rapid revision was required.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_326.wav|102|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_309.wav|64|Was that not awful?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_276.wav|5|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_274.wav|49|We can do nothing about that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_030.wav|32|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_362.wav|35|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_305.wav|38|He is a Satan.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_321.wav|8|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_116.wav|92|I have no plans to retire.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_354.wav|15|We are delighted with the result.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_023.wav|8|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_309.wav|8|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_279.wav|94|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_366.wav|55|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_044.wav|49|The failings are serious.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_382.wav|19|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_403.wav|62|No-one has yet been charged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_263.wav|55|He makes time for everyone.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_213.wav|23|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_131.wav|98|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_342.wav|72|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_257.wav|51|That will not change.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_082.wav|21|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_396.wav|34|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_336.wav|83|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_310.wav|6|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_310.wav|94|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_435.wav|75|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_356.wav|72|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_227.wav|47|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_120.wav|97|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_112.wav|40|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_028.wav|106|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_251.wav|54|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_316.wav|62|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_163.wav|49|But the price has been very high.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_172.wav|80|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_076.wav|96|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_002.wav|55|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_384.wav|82|They are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_195.wav|70|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_048.wav|8|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_212.wav|15|They continue to do so.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_292.wav|6|It was an achievement all right.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_072.wav|95|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_366.wav|42|I think we'll just keep it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_135.wav|106|Margins are also in retreat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_291.wav|94|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_119.wav|86|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_364.wav|51|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_197.wav|83|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_369.wav|36|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_255.wav|79|You don't see that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_252.wav|35|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_304.wav|77|We can work all night.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_028.wav|82|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_267.wav|5|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_081.wav|70|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_306.wav|91|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_329.wav|97|I feel it is very irrational.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_145.wav|14|You are a gambling man.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_153.wav|78|Others are expected to follow the lead.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_224.wav|95|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_120.wav|28|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_327.wav|53|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_104.wav|66|We are trying to establish a date.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_030.wav|97|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_106.wav|11|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_009.wav|44|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_291.wav|90|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_319.wav|49|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_212.wav|5|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_075.wav|4|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_143.wav|22|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_114.wav|80|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_231.wav|67|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_180.wav|76|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_178.wav|73|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_344.wav|87|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_363.wav|70|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_300.wav|93|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_411.wav|35|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_209.wav|16|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_442.wav|89|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_047.wav|79|They need to be helped.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_130.wav|21|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_129.wav|12|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_001.wav|40|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_011.wav|63|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_296.wav|4|Then there's the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_329.wav|1|I am not in denial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_391.wav|78|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_309.wav|3|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_254.wav|22|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_295.wav|47|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_253.wav|61|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_311.wav|36|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_384.wav|10|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_097.wav|83|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_298.wav|68|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_282.wav|99|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_271.wav|39|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_049.wav|12|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_260.wav|15|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_332.wav|16|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_179.wav|75|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_335.wav|84|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_370.wav|85|There is a changing of the guard.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_174.wav|87|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_380.wav|51|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_011.wav|40|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_058.wav|61|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_017.wav|13|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_401.wav|1|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_219.wav|18|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_299.wav|15|We know the goals will come.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_286.wav|16|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_027.wav|11|The game today is certainly different.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_273.wav|63|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_207.wav|105|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_256.wav|29|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_199.wav|67|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_147.wav|64|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_348.wav|44|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_232.wav|72|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_042.wav|8|Merger would be entirely logical.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_160.wav|34|It's the best of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_220.wav|22|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_410.wav|35|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_012.wav|80|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_347.wav|29|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_285.wav|68|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_219.wav|95|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_127.wav|50|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_380.wav|41|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_250.wav|32|He would not impose a fine.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_303.wav|85|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_265.wav|91|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_293.wav|89|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_082.wav|74|It is time to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_221.wav|14|We used to live with dignity in our country.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_172.wav|96|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_133.wav|77|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_063.wav|25|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_444.wav|106|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_314.wav|91|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_163.wav|7|The weather forecast isn't good.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_112.wav|82|He had a moustache.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_289.wav|61|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_070.wav|75|He was seen as the enemy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_055.wav|98|We said, What do you mean?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_352.wav|7|There will be good prospects ahead.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_245.wav|65|I go home only once.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_292.wav|96|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_243.wav|41|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_196.wav|81|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_203.wav|74|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_221.wav|1|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_373.wav|19|Frank Warren is a great man.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_028.wav|86|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_207.wav|97|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_268.wav|1|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_260.wav|72|It was a policy they were against.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_408.wav|24|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_059.wav|23|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_263.wav|56|Her body has never been found.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_190.wav|88|The state is controlled by the left.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_290.wav|12|This is a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_244.wav|32|Three weeks later, he resigned.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_058.wav|29|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_130.wav|17|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_097.wav|55|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_340.wav|107|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_166.wav|72|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_339.wav|78|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_025.wav|96|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_051.wav|56|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_303.wav|6|But they have the sound.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_248.wav|72|He was totally without that form of fear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_062.wav|7|He hadn't had them for a long time.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_278.wav|47|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_118.wav|19|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_112.wav|18|I still hope to go.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_129.wav|63|The firm also has a construction division.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_113.wav|94|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_053.wav|3|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_294.wav|2|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_358.wav|94|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_315.wav|25|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_451.wav|95|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_143.wav|48|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_165.wav|36|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_230.wav|58|I believe you may be that person.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_366.wav|25|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_354.wav|84|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_212.wav|37|It is time for confession.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_041.wav|43|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_120.wav|16|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_292.wav|39|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_080.wav|58|She added, It is a huge problem.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_118.wav|89|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_197.wav|51|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_440.wav|48|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_323.wav|42|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_264.wav|42|That's the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_325.wav|20|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_231.wav|4|They are just trying to cover up.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_091.wav|106|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_303.wav|20|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_233.wav|71|"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_450.wav|7|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_248.wav|33|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_309.wav|79|Does it make a profit?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_285.wav|7|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_083.wav|76|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_096.wav|9|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_010.wav|25|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_208.wav|27|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_038.wav|38|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_296.wav|95|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_272.wav|62|I don't know what he was shouting.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_173.wav|101|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_112.wav|58|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_154.wav|99|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_207.wav|44|The line-up is a tasty one.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_279.wav|88|He made no comment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_236.wav|32|Wilson will tell the truth.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_187.wav|53|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_396.wav|60|And what do we have?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_310.wav|26|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_126.wav|10|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_021.wav|15|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_240.wav|1|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_140.wav|67|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_132.wav|15|I had been hoping for justice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_143.wav|105|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_303.wav|36|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_148.wav|24|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_062.wav|45|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_123.wav|62|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_124.wav|10|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_072.wav|67|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_420.wav|65|He is very fast all right.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_084.wav|12|Why did they let him go?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_151.wav|36|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_128.wav|65|Eight others have followed.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_317.wav|33|He will be really pleased about this.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_163.wav|19|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_129.wav|17|We stopped at half-time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_388.wav|18|I cannot describe it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_258.wav|0|They were back in full training yesterday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_118.wav|13|We have no knowledge of this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_154.wav|65|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_013.wav|31|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_109.wav|89|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_342.wav|31|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_278.wav|70|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_231.wav|96|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_162.wav|59|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_474.wav|7|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_172.wav|88|We must do that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_010.wav|31|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_049.wav|61|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_240.wav|46|This is the subway.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_491.wav|65|This operation will change her life.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_044.wav|88|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_013.wav|15|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_169.wav|41|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_234.wav|19|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_024.wav|34|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_047.wav|97|We then went to see the headmaster.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_181.wav|72|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_335.wav|92|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_068.wav|84|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_267.wav|63|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_075.wav|40|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_219.wav|103|We find this very sad.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_005.wav|30|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_035.wav|93|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_259.wav|66|Our system is archaic.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_416.wav|0|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_135.wav|8|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_356.wav|60|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_319.wav|62|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_084.wav|10|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_090.wav|70|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_143.wav|24|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_352.wav|101|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_250.wav|107|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_117.wav|86|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_328.wav|93|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_047.wav|47|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_299.wav|52|He could understand both points of view.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_150.wav|92|We opened up and everything was gone.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_234.wav|2|You should be.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_006.wav|90|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_287.wav|67|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_192.wav|56|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_178.wav|103|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_045.wav|13|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_201.wav|85|I watch the other visitors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_398.wav|27|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_167.wav|60|But the action is about to be restarted.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_123.wav|72|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_180.wav|49|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_350.wav|58|The workers said they were treated like animals.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_190.wav|57|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_177.wav|53|It's just a different way of life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_380.wav|33|I am happy for her.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_235.wav|58|I will not be pressured.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_204.wav|93|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_113.wav|19|We played so well at times.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_401.wav|63|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_022.wav|23|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_340.wav|51|However, we had no failures on our side.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_200.wav|78|He has defended the system.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_326.wav|16|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_329.wav|63|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_389.wav|21|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_308.wav|26|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_365.wav|69|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_294.wav|33|Does it matter?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_213.wav|80|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_416.wav|100|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_266.wav|90|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_236.wav|11|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_342.wav|5|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_322.wav|66|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_278.wav|71|"Who will perform?"
DUMMY2/p240/p240_186.wav|93|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_298.wav|24|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_285.wav|58|You've got it coming Kabul.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_382.wav|104|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_272.wav|80|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_361.wav|107|They have not let anyone into the loop.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_402.wav|51|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_069.wav|31|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_109.wav|46|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_167.wav|65|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_018.wav|72|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_100.wav|70|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_069.wav|24|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_109.wav|27|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_448.wav|89|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_247.wav|54|They were at her bedside when she died.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_105.wav|82|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_379.wav|24|The countryside is in crisis.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_234.wav|99|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_454.wav|24|The removal would take place in France.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_192.wav|24|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_459.wav|75|Dennis was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_126.wav|4|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_221.wav|93|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_235.wav|55|Britain will be little affected.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_043.wav|89|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_294.wav|7|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_142.wav|12|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_466.wav|39|They're just a good retailer.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_107.wav|13|That, however, is the end of the good news.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_068.wav|75|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_393.wav|98|The truth is he probably doesn't.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_122.wav|69|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_048.wav|47|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_094.wav|46|The thing is to recognise that chance.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_014.wav|101|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_113.wav|33|What's the problem?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_290.wav|96|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_275.wav|105|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_210.wav|50|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_322.wav|15|I don't think it's very real.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_056.wav|23|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_171.wav|34|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_212.wav|7|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_287.wav|64|There are no plans to change this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_170.wav|105|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_403.wav|66|She will just have wanted her baby.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_338.wav|29|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_301.wav|64|I will carry on.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_243.wav|90|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_012.wav|64|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_175.wav|93|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_149.wav|35|However, he was later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_256.wav|80|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_272.wav|34|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_335.wav|44|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_100.wav|19|They have just got to believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_194.wav|58|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_353.wav|14|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_194.wav|103|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_221.wav|20|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_345.wav|45|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_035.wav|105|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_078.wav|86|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_083.wav|6|I have never seen anything like this.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_143.wav|17|I think this proposal is excellent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_256.wav|67|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_270.wav|46|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_091.wav|39|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_150.wav|39|Next time round, it will be different.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_046.wav|53|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_280.wav|64|We know we can't rely on you.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_231.wav|99|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_146.wav|81|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_123.wav|14|It isn't a happy memory.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_236.wav|96|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_045.wav|104|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_079.wav|36|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_043.wav|34|Now they have found out the truth.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_350.wav|69|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_388.wav|96|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_328.wav|20|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_050.wav|3|The strategy is not without risk.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_215.wav|95|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_305.wav|56|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_132.wav|53|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_353.wav|10|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_262.wav|74|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_313.wav|100|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_344.wav|107|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_048.wav|87|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_423.wav|77|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_348.wav|9|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_241.wav|32|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_198.wav|98|But who will buy it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_462.wav|75|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_227.wav|34|But who cares?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_040.wav|100|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_404.wav|40|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_362.wav|103|There may be some evidence to this effect.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_273.wav|7|I have received no explanation.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_322.wav|13|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_337.wav|13|To begin with it looks good.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_424.wav|38|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_214.wav|41|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_116.wav|9|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_265.wav|103|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_199.wav|66|What's the big idea?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_394.wav|39|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_094.wav|93|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_289.wav|19|I am not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_060.wav|23|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_178.wav|17|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_058.wav|15|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_039.wav|14|It depends on the decisions of the member states.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_114.wav|89|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_377.wav|46|It is just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_095.wav|6|If they are not, the commission will take action.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_156.wav|94|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_105.wav|10|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_378.wav|40|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_235.wav|57|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_284.wav|27|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_161.wav|102|You should be there with six different characters.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_348.wav|103|First is open defiance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_173.wav|24|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_253.wav|15|So what went wrong?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_347.wav|45|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_074.wav|67|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_335.wav|27|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_378.wav|68|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_372.wav|72|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_295.wav|9|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_350.wav|38|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_362.wav|43|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_054.wav|104|What is the point of jailing him?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_400.wav|14|That investment has now been secured.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_296.wav|107|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_104.wav|20|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_011.wav|21|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_118.wav|32|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_080.wav|99|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_057.wav|5|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_203.wav|105|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_051.wav|94|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_372.wav|69|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_071.wav|67|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_127.wav|55|It seemed like four hours.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_294.wav|43|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_180.wav|13|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_276.wav|65|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_277.wav|5|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_146.wav|71|"It is not just about pay."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_101.wav|39|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_185.wav|32|Women were mostly notable by their absence.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_404.wav|32|Neither man has been charged.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_336.wav|46|This is the start of a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_358.wav|54|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_196.wav|68|I don't know exactly what happened.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_360.wav|64|And we're talking Big Money.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_097.wav|84|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_259.wav|78|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_100.wav|36|Otherwise, the market may come back.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_012.wav|40|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_149.wav|19|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_123.wav|20|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_392.wav|35|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_020.wav|97|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_307.wav|68|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_359.wav|89|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_226.wav|48|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_212.wav|34|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_335.wav|15|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_276.wav|27|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_395.wav|19|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_169.wav|35|On the month the weakness was across the board.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_037.wav|39|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_472.wav|65|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_270.wav|94|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_183.wav|66|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_347.wav|92|Four years is a long time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_097.wav|100|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_048.wav|82|The opposite is the case.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_155.wav|61|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_227.wav|23|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_142.wav|15|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_368.wav|8|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_398.wav|56|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_035.wav|24|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_347.wav|50|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_283.wav|34|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_277.wav|24|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_240.wav|19|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_111.wav|96|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_098.wav|81|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_106.wav|44|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_154.wav|45|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_010.wav|93|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_031.wav|54|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_270.wav|71|"She looked so young."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_064.wav|100|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_195.wav|45|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_334.wav|18|No decisions have been taken.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_399.wav|91|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_126.wav|26|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_398.wav|54|Several people were out in the street.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_398.wav|16|It can help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_126.wav|105|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_375.wav|45|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_269.wav|0|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_057.wav|54|For example they could be in school uniform.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_118.wav|41|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_112.wav|97|That just wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_166.wav|73|He deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_130.wav|1|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_149.wav|40|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_126.wav|79|He has gone through the process before.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_033.wav|75|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_120.wav|33|We need to get the right people in.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_225.wav|78|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_247.wav|30|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_007.wav|55|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_283.wav|41|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_380.wav|19|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_171.wav|42|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_419.wav|76|I didn't play all that well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_383.wav|106|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_118.wav|84|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_245.wav|9|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p317/p317_405.wav|97|And our game is about going forward.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_037.wav|37|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_042.wav|90|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_407.wav|69|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_172.wav|4|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_287.wav|27|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_233.wav|53|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_107.wav|107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_164.wav|103|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_379.wav|47|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_217.wav|103|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_141.wav|91|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_148.wav|106|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_446.wav|63|He had no problems with discipline.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_333.wav|86|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_011.wav|78|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_323.wav|46|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_136.wav|49|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_419.wav|62|There was no pressure at all.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_035.wav|98|It was another good idea.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_159.wav|37|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_008.wav|103|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_318.wav|67|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_366.wav|35|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_202.wav|56|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_079.wav|100|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_103.wav|18|We should not be surprised at that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_393.wav|40|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_106.wav|81|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_018.wav|88|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_001.wav|5|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_245.wav|19|The truth is otherwise.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_289.wav|87|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_075.wav|79|They were looking for things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_327.wav|8|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_322.wav|7|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_177.wav|13|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_065.wav|25|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_415.wav|54|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_347.wav|40|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_311.wav|23|Four had been brought down.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_268.wav|88|I have got to keep the lid on.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_074.wav|63|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_070.wav|81|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_228.wav|3|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_295.wav|77|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_340.wav|53|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_252.wav|22|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_484.wav|24|It was a narrow escape.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_279.wav|67|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_141.wav|74|He was shaking like a leaf.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_272.wav|56|It was a horrible moment.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_350.wav|44|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_204.wav|67|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_097.wav|18|The search is due to be completed today.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_260.wav|27|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_041.wav|8|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_254.wav|15|We did not play well.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_131.wav|90|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_104.wav|40|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_412.wav|65|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_195.wav|81|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_110.wav|72|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_415.wav|56|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_124.wav|70|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_459.wav|8|We are over the moon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_340.wav|83|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_186.wav|92|I'm sure it will go on.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_268.wav|85|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_090.wav|61|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_301.wav|30|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_138.wav|70|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_094.wav|35|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_448.wav|27|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_101.wav|16|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_120.wav|75|The colours are very pretty.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_119.wav|71|"I was furious."
DUMMY2/p250/p250_120.wav|24|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_226.wav|99|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_296.wav|19|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_047.wav|32|I had trouble with the producers.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_214.wav|52|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_053.wav|78|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_030.wav|11|And that was just for starters.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_096.wav|14|The woman is basically off her head.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_391.wav|49|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_061.wav|54|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_175.wav|45|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_021.wav|33|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_190.wav|102|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_112.wav|106|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_440.wav|106|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_185.wav|16|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_109.wav|5|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_051.wav|14|We would have concerns about suspension.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_387.wav|51|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_066.wav|5|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_367.wav|94|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_227.wav|48|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_102.wav|63|I cannot believe this decision.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_276.wav|32|I couldn't honestly tell you.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_338.wav|5|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_240.wav|33|Now he is in charge of this.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_288.wav|58|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_316.wav|20|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_332.wav|23|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_386.wav|106|It must be tough to live with.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_257.wav|104|I get on him, he gets on me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_209.wav|100|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_090.wav|54|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_211.wav|91|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_096.wav|79|Nobody called me to explain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_173.wav|32|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_009.wav|89|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_230.wav|6|He was only doing his job.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_273.wav|104|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_008.wav|96|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_414.wav|16|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_283.wav|2|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_077.wav|2|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_244.wav|3|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_057.wav|15|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_232.wav|24|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_198.wav|7|Shelter also supports the reform.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_417.wav|8|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_221.wav|22|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.

DUMMY2/p339/p339_348.wav|18|How do we get a bigger stage?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_255.wav|103|I just went a bit too far.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_366.wav|76|The idea was presented to me.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_017.wav|48|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_281.wav|59|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_317.wav|64|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.

DUMMY2/p318/p318_348.wav|19|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_100.wav|6|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_277.wav|81|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_369.wav|86|There was no hint of scandal.

DUMMY2/p240/p240_290.wav|93|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_407.wav|19|As, indeed, they would be.

DUMMY2/p254/p254_387.wav|41|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_039.wav|66|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_254.wav|90|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_245.wav|34|There were no violations.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_218.wav|53|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_199.wav|11|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.

DUMMY2/p276/p276_101.wav|106|We are satisfied with this outcome.

DUMMY2/p298/p298_133.wav|68|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_127.wav|37|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_010.wav|96|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_398.wav|0|There were no plans for a rights issue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_260.wav|66|It was a tactical change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_313.wav|67|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_290.wav|33|We were used to being in control.

DUMMY2/p249/p249_024.wav|80|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.

DUMMY2/p351/p351_194.wav|33|It is crucial to understand this in context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_193.wav|100|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_129.wav|32|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_408.wav|16|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_023.wav|20|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

DUMMY2/p225/p225_175.wav|101|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.

DUMMY2/p298/p298_003.wav|68|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.

DUMMY2/p233/p233_218.wav|84|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_079.wav|54|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_139.wav|63|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_135.wav|15|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_077.wav|81|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_385.wav|70|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_152.wav|93|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_075.wav|32|Talk of a crisis is absurd.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_308.wav|96|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_400.wav|34|The Farmer is called an idiot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_370.wav|93|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_423.wav|32|This should put downward pressure on inflation.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_460.wav|100|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_046.wav|70|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_202.wav|41|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_039.wav|41|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_221.wav|102|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_062.wav|39|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_147.wav|59|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_005.wav|95|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_280.wav|59|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_140.wav|38|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_040.wav|42|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_200.wav|31|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_371.wav|60|I'm working on that one, too.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_200.wav|33|We need to know more about her.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_333.wav|45|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_062.wav|63|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_303.wav|84|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_324.wav|86|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_170.wav|13|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_178.wav|77|Being investor ready is a good start.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_007.wav|85|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_157.wav|14|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_371.wav|105|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_015.wav|23|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_023.wav|77|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_312.wav|34|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_005.wav|84|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_189.wav|36|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_140.wav|42|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_020.wav|41|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_365.wav|9|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_256.wav|90|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_176.wav|85|And you need to be so resourceful.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_020.wav|69|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_185.wav|74|Of course the ending was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_236.wav|44|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_178.wav|92|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_353.wav|65|It's clearly a budget.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_160.wav|59|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_113.wav|98|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_092.wav|95|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_364.wav|8|The value of the merger is still there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_340.wav|104|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_109.wav|56|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_354.wav|34|He died at the hands of his captors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_374.wav|87|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_056.wav|57|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_222.wav|85|Look at a computer.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_164.wav|63|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_315.wav|99|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_404.wav|63|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_102.wav|59|I have had no social life at all.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_054.wav|20|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_359.wav|26|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_336.wav|12|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_385.wav|41|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_038.wav|53|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_208.wav|46|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_179.wav|31|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_372.wav|68|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_122.wav|104|Did he just want to be on telly?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_057.wav|89|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_089.wav|49|We still don't know what's happened.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_099.wav|55|They prepared some food very quickly.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_008.wav|67|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_304.wav|55|But there's also a love for the songs.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_283.wav|53|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_193.wav|21|Is that not uncanny?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_059.wav|53|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_133.wav|83|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_145.wav|7|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_259.wav|1|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_315.wav|3|They have set the standard.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_027.wav|45|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_420.wav|22|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_316.wav|6|They want to win the title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_273.wav|64|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_310.wav|67|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_166.wav|80|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_413.wav|15|We are trying to do it properly.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_291.wav|86|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_025.wav|93|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_397.wav|102|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_380.wav|100|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_303.wav|96|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_018.wav|76|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_399.wav|92|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_366.wav|0|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_207.wav|67|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_035.wav|85|Why you did it will never be known.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_400.wav|23|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_137.wav|19|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_289.wav|106|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_151.wav|19|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_440.wav|27|In it went.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_147.wav|49|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_118.wav|68|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_308.wav|92|This is your chance.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_239.wav|39|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_256.wav|7|It had so much to do with output.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_330.wav|43|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_408.wav|78|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_185.wav|11|She has been unable to work since.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_169.wav|66|I am still very much a director.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_434.wav|65|A job is a job, after all.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_155.wav|26|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_173.wav|83|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_110.wav|42|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_011.wav|4|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_071.wav|59|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_123.wav|5|I just wanted a break.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_251.wav|71|"It is also very valuable."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_360.wav|95|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_045.wav|26|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_269.wav|92|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_400.wav|16|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_108.wav|75|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_322.wav|101|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_388.wav|17|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_182.wav|53|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_106.wav|98|Don't you believe it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_091.wav|52|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_180.wav|88|Our children are our future.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_214.wav|71|"I am really going to miss him."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_073.wav|95|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_357.wav|70|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_030.wav|61|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_231.wav|56|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_199.wav|54|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_105.wav|86|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_224.wav|8|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_259.wav|77|It is not enough to be first division champions.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_376.wav|10|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_348.wav|69|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_185.wav|86|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_089.wav|20|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_353.wav|46|It's a very special unit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_371.wav|17|Pray that is so.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_187.wav|97|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_020.wav|31|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_355.wav|41|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_039.wav|100|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_034.wav|16|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_049.wav|13|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_035.wav|31|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_230.wav|51|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_306.wav|65|He remains a main board director of Royal.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_314.wav|104|It is three years at present.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_096.wav|103|Jamming would be equally difficult.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_315.wav|45|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_268.wav|63|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_379.wav|11|I am not changing my mind.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_044.wav|102|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_351.wav|80|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_157.wav|38|This commitment should be built upon.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_088.wav|17|However, it is no longer with the national team.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_304.wav|69|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_100.wav|41|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_223.wav|7|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_047.wav|86|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_408.wav|18|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_215.wav|59|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_285.wav|51|It's part of the game, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_108.wav|26|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_440.wav|7|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_034.wav|47|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_327.wav|81|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_404.wav|60|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_441.wav|65|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_205.wav|88|It is so beautiful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_404.wav|98|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_050.wav|102|Except for this, it was offside.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_026.wav|38|I want to win this thing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_304.wav|105|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_397.wav|36|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_446.wav|14|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_431.wav|32|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_040.wav|1|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_408.wav|66|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_021.wav|0|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_163.wav|80|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_105.wav|30|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_176.wav|59|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_308.wav|3|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_143.wav|61|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_346.wav|68|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_400.wav|36|Adventure is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_435.wav|27|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_240.wav|14|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_345.wav|75|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_386.wav|76|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_303.wav|5|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_045.wav|80|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_198.wav|74|This is a disaster for us.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_433.wav|75|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_308.wav|80|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_227.wav|32|We played them off the pitch.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_084.wav|20|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_229.wav|45|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_369.wav|23|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_030.wav|55|Schools do not create that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_241.wav|8|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_100.wav|20|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_006.wav|0|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_423.wav|13|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_272.wav|72|People were actually not on his side.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_130.wav|37|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_066.wav|31|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_220.wav|43|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_037.wav|55|Instead, we make the ground pay.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_152.wav|68|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_258.wav|70|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_457.wav|14|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_221.wav|95|They are still very quiet.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_293.wav|18|I'm not there yet but it is close.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_282.wav|72|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_255.wav|3|The world is a good place.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_411.wav|49|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_404.wav|104|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_208.wav|73|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_151.wav|85|They will appear again next week.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_183.wav|55|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_316.wav|9|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_410.wav|60|I intend to end it on a high.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_248.wav|63|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_269.wav|33|There were moments of humour too.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_057.wav|13|One woman refused to sit down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_098.wav|7|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_361.wav|37|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_138.wav|30|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_269.wav|105|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_173.wav|15|An inquiry has begun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_238.wav|23|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_180.wav|19|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_075.wav|18|But there was no time for that.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_038.wav|95|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_296.wav|65|Perhaps they were right.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_028.wav|56|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_060.wav|96|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_232.wav|50|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_361.wav|21|These things have not happened by accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_132.wav|102|I've always been desperate to play this part.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_092.wav|62|I am very encouraged by this poll.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_295.wav|0|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_273.wav|32|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_164.wav|10|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_111.wav|90|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_063.wav|72|No details were disclosed.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_386.wav|6|I loved it - and so did my friend.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_080.wav|50|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_133.wav|12|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_283.wav|30|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_088.wav|79|It's just a failing service.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_306.wav|29|It is an amazing response.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_029.wav|107|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_052.wav|43|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_043.wav|81|We will push.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_259.wav|4|How can this be?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_063.wav|35|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_216.wav|55|The questions came quick and fast.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_007.wav|44|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_405.wav|105|No preference emerged.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_178.wav|65|We just want this session to end.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_128.wav|6|We are getting not a penny.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_177.wav|14|That must be left to the Parole Board.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_115.wav|15|Anyone can take a photo.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_030.wav|18|It was really good in the first week.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_289.wav|2|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_259.wav|84|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_397.wav|10|It has happened for generations.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_264.wav|87|The planning appears to have paid off.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_394.wav|26|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_269.wav|3|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_317.wav|45|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_249.wav|92|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_322.wav|61|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_242.wav|21|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_006.wav|23|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_356.wav|17|But he is frustrated at every turn.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_199.wav|8|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_097.wav|41|You will be.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_121.wav|83|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_094.wav|82|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_199.wav|106|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_088.wav|68|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_283.wav|105|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_424.wav|7|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_015.wav|79|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_006.wav|8|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_072.wav|51|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_318.wav|46|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_296.wav|24|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_349.wav|46|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_330.wav|41|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_246.wav|84|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_153.wav|91|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_038.wav|10|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_340.wav|12|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_369.wav|65|That is for white people.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_391.wav|77|But we are very near.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_272.wav|81|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_240.wav|81|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_046.wav|103|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_254.wav|57|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_162.wav|42|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_214.wav|75|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_010.wav|3|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_121.wav|23|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_048.wav|85|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_352.wav|6|He was later deported.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_104.wav|15|They know their son was murdered.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_342.wav|39|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_073.wav|74|This can be extreme.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_248.wav|24|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_055.wav|80|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_014.wav|71|"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "
DUMMY2/p237/p237_304.wav|61|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_158.wav|19|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_032.wav|16|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_263.wav|22|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_341.wav|20|But I was knocked out by the city.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_468.wav|75|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_255.wav|107|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_322.wav|86|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_489.wav|48|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_258.wav|7|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_070.wav|71|"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers."
DUMMY2/p301/p301_324.wav|91|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_215.wav|63|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_067.wav|15|I don't have a problem with it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_199.wav|78|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_044.wav|74|That was a month ago.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_143.wav|58|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_188.wav|85|That would end it for us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_300.wav|51|A statement is expected in April.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_162.wav|58|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_311.wav|21|They need to be involved.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_233.wav|100|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_181.wav|25|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_367.wav|27|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_036.wav|77|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_354.wav|68|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_132.wav|49|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_278.wav|67|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_230.wav|72|That could run into millions.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_368.wav|93|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_320.wav|60|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_083.wav|30|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_130.wav|39|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_036.wav|105|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_185.wav|80|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_028.wav|13|They are being deported from their homes.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_062.wav|76|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_065.wav|91|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_245.wav|106|We were right to be afraid.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_377.wav|16|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_164.wav|34|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_082.wav|18|I won't let that happen.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_285.wav|86|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_231.wav|62|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_408.wav|103|It would show them a positive way forward.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_026.wav|99|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_194.wav|84|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_208.wav|36|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_402.wav|7|They were to blame for the first two goals.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_221.wav|6|We don't want that at all.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_181.wav|55|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_177.wav|50|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_363.wav|86|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_266.wav|100|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_031.wav|14|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_402.wav|68|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_265.wav|17|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_233.wav|90|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_342.wav|9|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_131.wav|104|I can't see him reversing that.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_266.wav|5|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_326.wav|33|I played well but missed a few chances.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_156.wav|92|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_276.wav|4|They also intend to travel today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_411.wav|79|I found that we couldn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_031.wav|98|It is sending the wrong message to people.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_016.wav|20|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_191.wav|14|I put the drawing down.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_110.wav|85|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_274.wav|31|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_218.wav|57|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_288.wav|103|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_388.wav|63|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_175.wav|15|That is not, however, the case.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_257.wav|98|This is a personal decision for me.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_087.wav|52|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_289.wav|102|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_060.wav|102|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_263.wav|16|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_122.wav|23|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_333.wav|3|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_117.wav|21|He also has property interests in the country.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_180.wav|39|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_335.wav|62|The playing is perfectly turned out.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_093.wav|77|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_207.wav|38|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_196.wav|18|It was a very strong metaphor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_178.wav|23|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_004.wav|40|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_359.wav|93|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_179.wav|39|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_071.wav|62|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_308.wav|86|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_174.wav|0|It is not a threat.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_250.wav|16|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_237.wav|32|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_171.wav|9|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_018.wav|27|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_468.wav|63|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_215.wav|89|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_224.wav|55|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_238.wav|6|I am very sorry to hear about this.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_061.wav|31|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_349.wav|41|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_064.wav|27|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_189.wav|90|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_212.wav|103|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_149.wav|22|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_237.wav|18|I think we're the better side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_208.wav|85|My husband was fighting for his life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_202.wav|2|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_289.wav|4|Fame and money followed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_422.wav|20|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_007.wav|8|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_276.wav|85|I just wanted to fly.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_352.wav|89|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_104.wav|70|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_100.wav|1|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_367.wav|42|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_365.wav|54|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_062.wav|42|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_340.wav|69|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_004.wav|28|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_178.wav|87|We are happy with the referee.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_040.wav|61|It's a great thing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_331.wav|53|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_417.wav|64|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_185.wav|85|That, in a way, is the point.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_101.wav|77|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_132.wav|103|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_291.wav|100|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_134.wav|23|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_225.wav|86|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_326.wav|18|We are going to listen to Britain.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_301.wav|47|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_179.wav|1|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_045.wav|106|And they had a case.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_366.wav|100|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_401.wav|49|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_072.wav|69|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_429.wav|100|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_159.wav|86|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_183.wav|70|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_316.wav|47|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_379.wav|0|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_285.wav|84|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_163.wav|15|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_242.wav|58|I was the only one arguing differently.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_450.wav|50|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_311.wav|85|It divided audiences at Cannes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_350.wav|45|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_312.wav|99|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_279.wav|63|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_377.wav|33|She makes me so happy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_425.wav|105|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_158.wav|96|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_011.wav|72|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_013.wav|44|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_019.wav|51|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_335.wav|106|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_209.wav|42|It's a metaphor for consumption.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_271.wav|80|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_257.wav|103|This is a wonderful honour for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_025.wav|76|They will be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_145.wav|61|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_077.wav|46|One thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_261.wav|102|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_373.wav|62|He said he needed no more evidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_164.wav|84|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_112.wav|84|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_088.wav|21|I will report in the spring.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_129.wav|24|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_297.wav|92|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_050.wav|51|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_215.wav|60|I can understand that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_281.wav|12|This is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_189.wav|56|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_015.wav|87|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_280.wav|33|This is welcome news.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_235.wav|99|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_225.wav|62|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_073.wav|33|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_287.wav|44|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_209.wav|69|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_397.wav|24|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_044.wav|80|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_142.wav|3|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_129.wav|80|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_228.wav|75|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_268.wav|96|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_260.wav|38|They would be wise to do just that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_301.wav|37|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_268.wav|57|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_029.wav|59|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_052.wav|89|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_349.wav|93|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_033.wav|87|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_277.wav|92|I've never regretted my decision.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_280.wav|28|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_208.wav|64|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_298.wav|67|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_329.wav|101|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_252.wav|8|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_471.wav|48|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_305.wav|59|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_134.wav|87|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_093.wav|46|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_386.wav|77|It was like a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_130.wav|67|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_238.wav|0|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_066.wav|66|He is pretty upset.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_279.wav|45|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_324.wav|36|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_134.wav|70|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_055.wav|36|The Government should be ashamed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_245.wav|83|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_293.wav|42|But today was the real big one.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_015.wav|83|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_043.wav|43|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_048.wav|66|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_167.wav|69|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_272.wav|4|They still have the dirty work to do.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_194.wav|63|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_308.wav|59|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_191.wav|89|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_254.wav|104|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_218.wav|80|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_352.wav|36|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_328.wav|37|Margins are also in retreat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_151.wav|26|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_290.wav|57|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_257.wav|13|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_381.wav|20|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_291.wav|34|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_206.wav|62|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_205.wav|55|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_216.wav|73|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_270.wav|52|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_125.wav|1|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_334.wav|48|Royal Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_330.wav|96|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_091.wav|53|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_331.wav|35|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_024.wav|10|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_168.wav|60|It was extremely difficult.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_034.wav|99|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_199.wav|23|I am just looking to God.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_182.wav|68|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_233.wav|14|It will be strictly cross-country.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_068.wav|97|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_460.wav|32|Let that be their memorial.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_026.wav|57|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_281.wav|50|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_041.wav|9|They may be wrong.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_189.wav|87|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_095.wav|100|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_115.wav|76|Such a policy would be a disaster.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_098.wav|70|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_186.wav|74|I want to be frank.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_250.wav|91|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_033.wav|22|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_162.wav|64|That's been our position all along.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_105.wav|45|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_001.wav|17|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_345.wav|41|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_184.wav|72|An announcement is expected today on their future.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_259.wav|63|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_379.wav|68|I have beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_292.wav|25|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_005.wav|62|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_295.wav|89|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_402.wav|16|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_357.wav|101|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_385.wav|75|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_345.wav|50|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_359.wav|28|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_290.wav|15|Yet it seemed to work.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_229.wav|100|Life is too short to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_410.wav|91|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_055.wav|56|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_392.wav|75|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_449.wav|24|That will be best for him.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_112.wav|11|It was a sickening sight.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_080.wav|55|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_302.wav|63|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_304.wav|46|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_053.wav|56|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_281.wav|65|He will get his chances.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_277.wav|10|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_282.wav|103|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_053.wav|7|We have not given up hope.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_126.wav|31|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_057.wav|51|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_086.wav|105|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_163.wav|5|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_289.wav|16|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_455.wav|32|It was like someone had died.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_405.wav|63|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_112.wav|28|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_226.wav|92|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_207.wav|6|We have still got the fight in us.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_081.wav|94|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_098.wav|17|I don't know how it happened.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_365.wav|46|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_026.wav|67|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_477.wav|7|The price paid for it was not disclosed.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_417.wav|75|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_227.wav|8|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_060.wav|80|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_298.wav|66|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_277.wav|23|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_213.wav|73|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_164.wav|65|The options seem limited.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_110.wav|41|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_314.wav|78|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_196.wav|1|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_324.wav|48|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_021.wav|28|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_099.wav|37|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_055.wav|28|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_237.wav|10|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_150.wav|34|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_300.wav|72|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_034.wav|102|Blood samples have been taken.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_299.wav|38|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_081.wav|30|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_385.wav|56|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_140.wav|95|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_344.wav|82|We live in shorthand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_422.wav|104|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_055.wav|64|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_372.wav|8|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_278.wav|63|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_150.wav|102|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_040.wav|36|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_258.wav|14|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_128.wav|50|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_332.wav|7|What are they for ?)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_285.wav|71|"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_131.wav|39|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_166.wav|17|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_023.wav|101|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_087.wav|78|It would have been around the turn of the century.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_185.wav|67|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_380.wav|75|People are on the alert.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_201.wav|91|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_335.wav|32|He has left the company.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_083.wav|74|Everyone in front of me was dead.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_363.wav|95|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_354.wav|13|The board of governors must act.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_037.wav|67|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_115.wav|24|It's good to have a voice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_190.wav|0|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_280.wav|63|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_292.wav|64|My wife is totally behind me on this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_324.wav|46|This is my music.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_237.wav|100|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_334.wav|58|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_324.wav|19|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_276.wav|7|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_246.wav|100|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_372.wav|89|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_330.wav|86|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_389.wav|92|The team is in division one in Spain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_330.wav|27|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_383.wav|89|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_165.wav|13|Are you all right at the front?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_057.wav|1|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_437.wav|27|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_405.wav|1|We didn't know if people would turn up.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_393.wav|64|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_063.wav|71|"Art is extra."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_186.wav|39|Time is now very short.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_252.wav|72|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_111.wav|85|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_303.wav|107|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_097.wav|14|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_275.wav|81|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_090.wav|17|This is the best moment of my career.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_179.wav|22|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_275.wav|12|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_006.wav|6|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_168.wav|54|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_142.wav|56|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_183.wav|49|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_232.wav|57|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_310.wav|105|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_316.wav|22|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_379.wav|105|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_128.wav|76|What has changed since then?

DUMMY2/p314/p314_046.wav|51|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_268.wav|44|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_265.wav|5|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_218.wav|68|We didn't know if people would turn up.

DUMMY2/p305/p305_083.wav|54|However, it is much bigger than that.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_421.wav|38|I think it is totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_148.wav|80|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_031.wav|59|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_075.wav|60|It's worth it, though.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_022.wav|6|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_023.wav|66|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_117.wav|62|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_213.wav|59|It was good fun.

DUMMY2/p232/p232_307.wav|96|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_203.wav|47|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_217.wav|32|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_045.wav|42|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.

DUMMY2/p254/p254_034.wav|41|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_290.wav|9|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.

DUMMY2/p259/p259_123.wav|7|We had another last Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_149.wav|41|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_125.wav|45|The goals were good.

DUMMY2/p244/p244_171.wav|78|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_224.wav|104|It should be a pretty exciting session.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_276.wav|50|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_129.wav|10|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_064.wav|86|The script was funny.

DUMMY2/p244/p244_367.wav|78|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_408.wav|92|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_024.wav|77|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_067.wav|105|It's all I can do.

DUMMY2/p262/p262_325.wav|45|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_382.wav|26|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_194.wav|7|I cannot say too much about them.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_193.wav|15|This is a business.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_016.wav|103|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_074.wav|38|It was very personal and very intimate.

DUMMY2/p276/p276_131.wav|106|Diversions were put in place.

DUMMY2/p292/p292_397.wav|13|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_257.wav|17|No, is the answer to your first question.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_356.wav|65|We accept the new rules.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_395.wav|42|It was to be published next month.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_035.wav|72|But there was a heavy price to pay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_012.wav|97|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_126.wav|66|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_176.wav|12|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_273.wav|35|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_187.wav|40|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_330.wav|39|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_036.wav|85|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_072.wav|18|Today is the first step in that process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_193.wav|94|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_355.wav|32|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_122.wav|94|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_049.wav|23|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_196.wav|26|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_227.wav|83|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_270.wav|12|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_307.wav|31|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_118.wav|98|But no, it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_076.wav|98|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_180.wav|18|A film is different from a book.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_003.wav|44|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_290.wav|30|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_337.wav|37|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_177.wav|42|I couldn't honestly tell you.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_019.wav|47|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_431.wav|37|We go there with confidence.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_353.wav|83|And he laughs.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_065.wav|29|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_374.wav|24|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_275.wav|92|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_038.wav|70|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_065.wav|74|This has been a long process.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_300.wav|34|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_191.wav|44|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_121.wav|40|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_033.wav|106|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_040.wav|13|I wish the solutions were as easy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_388.wav|7|It was a massive error of judgment.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_034.wav|93|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_010.wav|33|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_294.wav|107|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_217.wav|45|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_032.wav|17|I can't believe something like this could happen.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_281.wav|96|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_349.wav|66|I've already got them in.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_202.wav|58|He explained to his audience.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_264.wav|90|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_224.wav|97|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_128.wav|15|I had never done anything like it before.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_359.wav|97|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_181.wav|50|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_223.wav|10|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_262.wav|66|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_136.wav|106|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_373.wav|56|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_158.wav|9|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_334.wav|11|We just want them home.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_053.wav|43|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_398.wav|89|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_206.wav|24|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_284.wav|15|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_376.wav|69|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_254.wav|62|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_119.wav|87|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_432.wav|8|In fact, the reasons are simple.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_368.wav|18|He is doing just that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_285.wav|37|But I was glad to see these interviews.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_341.wav|6|I don't know, really.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_046.wav|80|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_203.wav|71|"I don't want to use it."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_002.wav|75|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_105.wav|14|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_199.wav|53|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_372.wav|19|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_020.wav|8|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_365.wav|22|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_310.wav|30|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_025.wav|80|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_290.wav|23|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_363.wav|41|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_424.wav|50|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_052.wav|22|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_037.wav|40|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_086.wav|53|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_216.wav|64|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_249.wav|5|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_143.wav|89|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_420.wav|19|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_228.wav|74|I don't like to fail.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_232.wav|18|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_262.wav|63|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_364.wav|93|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_014.wav|2|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_244.wav|60|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_286.wav|83|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_123.wav|64|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_316.wav|57|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_342.wav|26|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_176.wav|73|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_128.wav|96|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_399.wav|49|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_167.wav|27|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_339.wav|39|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_236.wav|30|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_022.wav|85|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_257.wav|85|I have totally had enough.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_292.wav|28|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_069.wav|76|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_198.wav|36|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_302.wav|0|I am a retailer by nature.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_110.wav|94|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_423.wav|104|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_257.wav|81|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_204.wav|13|She made no further comment.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_415.wav|14|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_285.wav|67|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_204.wav|98|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_138.wav|53|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_189.wav|22|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_269.wav|45|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_060.wav|57|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_238.wav|24|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_088.wav|14|Those people must be accountable.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_042.wav|2|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_369.wav|10|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_201.wav|52|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_187.wav|95|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_056.wav|98|I have been there many times.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_130.wav|44|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_353.wav|37|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_431.wav|65|We cannot ask for them back.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_193.wav|76|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_276.wav|94|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_205.wav|31|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_484.wav|75|That is the bottom line.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_071.wav|101|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_012.wav|25|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_109.wav|52|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_013.wav|92|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_124.wav|30|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_035.wav|107|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_138.wav|44|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_165.wav|81|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_143.wav|8|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_290.wav|106|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_414.wav|50|They are looking for profit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_036.wav|92|She asked me for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_104.wav|23|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_310.wav|5|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_204.wav|15|I'm looking forward to coming home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_190.wav|41|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_002.wav|65|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY2/p313/p313_342.wav|76|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_384.wav|105|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_051.wav|93|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_282.wav|60|It was important to bring them all together.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_275.wav|11|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_083.wav|52|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_230.wav|62|He was replaced by John Spencer.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_201.wav|44|It was a very difficult decision for us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_313.wav|82|They were not missing much.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_212.wav|77|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_169.wav|58|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_308.wav|69|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_123.wav|104|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_461.wav|100|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_072.wav|45|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_073.wav|103|He would be with his peers.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_093.wav|19|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_491.wav|75|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_017.wav|16|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_076.wav|60|That perhaps is behind the problem.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_287.wav|92|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_182.wav|44|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_012.wav|94|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_213.wav|86|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_459.wav|63|The damage has been done.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_355.wav|55|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_307.wav|34|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_181.wav|67|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_053.wav|25|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_178.wav|14|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_153.wav|99|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_390.wav|29|Celtic were pleased to help.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_037.wav|103|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_213.wav|85|I got very, very tired.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_352.wav|26|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_252.wav|106|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_352.wav|33|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_232.wav|46|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_310.wav|10|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_385.wav|96|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_379.wav|64|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_324.wav|34|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_257.wav|27|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_200.wav|27|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_045.wav|78|They are going after them.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_342.wav|93|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_154.wav|88|Everyone would have been happy.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_113.wav|89|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_269.wav|30|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_036.wav|96|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_073.wav|48|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_237.wav|105|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_409.wav|48|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_416.wav|77|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_086.wav|72|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_206.wav|15|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_093.wav|30|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_258.wav|4|The family baton is handed on.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_347.wav|104|It's just not our biggest problem.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_288.wav|26|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_358.wav|65|He could still be President.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_193.wav|1|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_003.wav|55|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_122.wav|3|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_330.wav|66|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_101.wav|74|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p298/p298_214.wav|68|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_351.wav|72|It is no place for a poet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_136.wav|78|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_476.wav|75|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_159.wav|43|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_100.wav|64|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_313.wav|39|I have decided to stand down from the list.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_280.wav|99|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_027.wav|87|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_300.wav|10|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_280.wav|95|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_258.wav|102|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_281.wav|27|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_020.wav|80|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_265.wav|41|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_024.wav|7|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_109.wav|83|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_018.wav|21|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_303.wav|87|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_265.wav|73|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_092.wav|11|It's not right of Labour.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_331.wav|61|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_407.wav|105|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_148.wav|53|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_402.wav|92|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_277.wav|19|It's an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_395.wav|18|You can feel the tension in the air.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_228.wav|47|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_089.wav|103|It's very difficult and very worrying.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_058.wav|62|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_137.wav|51|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_004.wav|43|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_207.wav|52|I want an answer from the British Government.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_133.wav|0|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_379.wav|26|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_130.wav|43|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_229.wav|92|Knowledge is everything at this level.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_089.wav|4|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_087.wav|77|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_403.wav|91|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_069.wav|45|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_292.wav|107|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_157.wav|84|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_330.wav|56|They will have to cut through the roof.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_184.wav|14|It is not either national standards or local control.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_224.wav|37|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_351.wav|83|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_370.wav|62|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_029.wav|19|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_060.wav|15|They're interested only in profits.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_080.wav|59|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_281.wav|7|We will listen to any suggestion.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_267.wav|37|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_224.wav|53|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_329.wav|37|Golf is not like that.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_344.wav|23|He is dying from cancer.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_197.wav|62|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_408.wav|69|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_240.wav|82|There are two options.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_090.wav|95|You have to respect the office.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_161.wav|65|No such meeting took place.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_352.wav|75|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_176.wav|48|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_001.wav|23|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_035.wav|89|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_057.wav|62|This is welcome news.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_046.wav|34|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_429.wav|65|The people are nice, though.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_384.wav|26|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_051.wav|46|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_057.wav|41|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_229.wav|2|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_131.wav|102|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_295.wav|13|They are in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_163.wav|42|We meet again in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_384.wav|84|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_112.wav|86|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_091.wav|57|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_099.wav|24|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_023.wav|91|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_262.wav|87|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_130.wav|56|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_112.wav|46|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_405.wav|16|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_207.wav|87|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_226.wav|58|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_299.wav|43|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_224.wav|105|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_417.wav|40|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_092.wav|58|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_063.wav|65|You could very well be.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_255.wav|24|The right decision has been made.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_007.wav|54|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_384.wav|33|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_371.wav|20|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_099.wav|94|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_290.wav|56|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_366.wav|39|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_432.wav|106|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_248.wav|56|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_240.wav|76|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_427.wav|100|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_163.wav|59|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_079.wav|4|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_458.wav|39|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_244.wav|36|Wilson will tell the truth.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_095.wav|9|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_342.wav|100|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_217.wav|56|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_013.wav|51|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_343.wav|19|It's no less intriguing, however.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_144.wav|79|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_401.wav|19|I found that much more challenging.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_334.wav|32|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_347.wav|93|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_106.wav|102|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_129.wav|107|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_348.wav|41|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_380.wav|11|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_099.wav|97|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_389.wav|56|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_231.wav|42|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_017.wav|40|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_003.wav|72|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_153.wav|27|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_175.wav|82|We should have gone solo.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_230.wav|14|William Hague delighted his party.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_144.wav|23|The Treasury denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_026.wav|52|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_077.wav|28|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_187.wav|27|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_315.wav|60|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_040.wav|95|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_030.wav|4|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_141.wav|57|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_410.wav|15|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_113.wav|80|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_262.wav|10|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_312.wav|20|You should be.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_340.wav|35|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_205.wav|30|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_255.wav|68|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_378.wav|13|That would have killed the match.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_291.wav|58|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_061.wav|36|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_343.wav|86|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_253.wav|76|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_401.wav|51|The best option is to destroy the plants.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_358.wav|32|Governments will have to respond.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_038.wav|103|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_003.wav|94|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_311.wav|75|We can work all night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_176.wav|99|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_066.wav|1|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_224.wav|1|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_257.wav|34|Are we here?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_212.wav|47|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_111.wav|39|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_106.wav|77|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_379.wav|46|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_297.wav|95|They are very keen to work with us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_208.wav|79|The pace is telling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_103.wav|106|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_174.wav|95|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_189.wav|94|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_352.wav|100|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_408.wav|74|My daughter was really, really innocent.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_410.wav|6|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_102.wav|55|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_084.wav|6|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_231.wav|1|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_014.wav|17|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_174.wav|60|I was a silly bastard.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_117.wav|81|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_315.wav|72|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_399.wav|24|The law would appear to be on our side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_260.wav|100|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_052.wav|66|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_274.wav|76|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_038.wav|77|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_185.wav|105|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_345.wav|43|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_076.wav|62|He was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_218.wav|0|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_284.wav|8|I understand the security issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_264.wav|92|What was the cause of all this outrage?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_015.wav|30|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_225.wav|88|We just have to improve.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_306.wav|0|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_366.wav|102|And here is the rub.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_254.wav|37|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_108.wav|21|I've got to get noticed!
DUMMY2/p363/p363_298.wav|6|What was the cause of all this outrage?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_175.wav|56|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_396.wav|10|The law would appear to be on our side.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_032.wav|32|Costs have got to be controlled.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_226.wav|11|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_124.wav|58|Yet he chose to do something different.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_320.wav|32|Are they free ?)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_057.wav|37|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_231.wav|105|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_327.wav|17|The goal will stay with me forever.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_290.wav|24|I feel really confident in that department.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_012.wav|95|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_327.wav|91|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_162.wav|95|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_234.wav|94|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_064.wav|72|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_231.wav|9|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_406.wav|87|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_125.wav|67|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_298.wav|81|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_046.wav|63|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_339.wav|64|I always said No.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_221.wav|51|The text is reduced to bubbles.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_126.wav|107|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_301.wav|29|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_203.wav|56|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_094.wav|18|He doesn't even know who he is.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_414.wav|64|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_332.wav|34|Such is the ego involved.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_335.wav|49|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_091.wav|50|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_013.wav|42|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_300.wav|67|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_217.wav|16|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_359.wav|9|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_323.wav|54|We didn't know he was even out.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_045.wav|36|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_353.wav|100|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_067.wav|63|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_125.wav|16|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_270.wav|49|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_235.wav|34|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_163.wav|66|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_326.wav|79|It just got out of control.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_027.wav|82|All the people here are local.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_001.wav|84|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_004.wav|8|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_093.wav|4|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_213.wav|34|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_502.wav|48|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_266.wav|4|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_136.wav|77|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_278.wav|59|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_128.wav|102|She says the royal family get on well.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_264.wav|78|It expected this trend to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_018.wav|64|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_097.wav|3|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_138.wav|38|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_001.wav|60|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_102.wav|18|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_432.wav|56|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_252.wav|86|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_305.wav|81|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_239.wav|100|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_059.wav|28|This is all part of opening the door.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_256.wav|83|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_290.wav|22|Everything has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_070.wav|1|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_191.wav|9|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_316.wav|16|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_012.wav|105|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_131.wav|85|Too much has already been said.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_025.wav|44|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_107.wav|29|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_009.wav|4|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_073.wav|32|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_073.wav|41|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_174.wav|19|Dewar is the medium.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_179.wav|6|Perhaps it was just as well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_200.wav|106|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_092.wav|27|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_073.wav|9|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_151.wav|60|This has been carried out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_347.wav|91|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_298.wav|56|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_109.wav|94|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_360.wav|70|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_314.wav|84|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_153.wav|8|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_391.wav|68|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_113.wav|68|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_272.wav|18|It was a classic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_116.wav|63|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_142.wav|90|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_037.wav|19|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_135.wav|43|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_298.wav|45|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_015.wav|77|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_333.wav|96|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_009.wav|50|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_417.wav|50|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_252.wav|62|Was it a foul?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_312.wav|66|There is nothing like a fresh start.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_081.wav|16|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_053.wav|34|How well did they get on?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_159.wav|42|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_192.wav|12|These elements are in the book.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_019.wav|37|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_313.wav|80|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_405.wav|47|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_345.wav|91|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_186.wav|41|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_061.wav|53|Talks have continued at many different levels.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_121.wav|76|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_141.wav|101|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_026.wav|49|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_141.wav|5|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_201.wav|89|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_156.wav|73|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_091.wav|30|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_443.wav|14|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_385.wav|106|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_286.wav|38|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_229.wav|93|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_360.wav|24|What form did that take ?

DUMMY2/p297/p297_002.wav|42|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_143.wav|47|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_302.wav|55|So does every industry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_326.wav|12|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_255.wav|33|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_370.wav|74|It is a tragedy for the area.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_056.wav|73|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_209.wav|80|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_300.wav|74|Police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_349.wav|20|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_293.wav|10|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_385.wav|32|It will be completed within a year.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_274.wav|22|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_090.wav|47|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_067.wav|74|It's probably just as well.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_234.wav|75|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_293.wav|103|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_213.wav|77|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_250.wav|49|Alex is a big part of that future.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_053.wav|45|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_078.wav|105|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_285.wav|99|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_137.wav|62|I was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_254.wav|28|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_280.wav|7|No date has been fixed for his return.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_222.wav|16|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_050.wav|19|My brother is buried under there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_405.wav|26|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_167.wav|9|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_182.wav|103|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_257.wav|57|Is that a serious question ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_313.wav|11|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_238.wav|72|But they will need to play to score.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_087.wav|22|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_195.wav|72|They will have five minutes to decide.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_394.wav|78|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_080.wav|12|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_145.wav|22|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_266.wav|95|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_383.wav|10|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_186.wav|42|Some may end up in hospital.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_043.wav|72|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_365.wav|24|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_346.wav|57|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_358.wav|76|Closure is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_074.wav|80|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_287.wav|3|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_263.wav|77|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_329.wav|27|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_089.wav|6|It was decided he should be dismissed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_205.wav|107|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_077.wav|97|Will we ever play together again?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_096.wav|39|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_254.wav|34|Everything is up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_135.wav|67|It's an amazing landscape !
DUMMY2/p285/p285_403.wav|2|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_215.wav|69|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_039.wav|87|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_269.wav|90|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_332.wav|20|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_332.wav|102|He made no big mistakes.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_087.wav|8|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_054.wav|103|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_391.wav|54|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_179.wav|81|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_387.wav|32|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_205.wav|49|It is best value.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_333.wav|100|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_239.wav|55|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_375.wav|16|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_159.wav|18|The enemy was time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_374.wav|4|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_151.wav|3|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_132.wav|80|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_202.wav|20|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_298.wav|99|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_095.wav|103|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_218.wav|6|Where is the evidence?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_235.wav|56|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_134.wav|62|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_142.wav|105|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_102.wav|50|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_285.wav|44|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_389.wav|85|I can't describe it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_245.wav|10|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_233.wav|43|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_299.wav|88|You will be very, very welcome.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_033.wav|52|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_376.wav|34|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_334.wav|82|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_264.wav|3|Scotland played a major part in the project.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_217.wav|0|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_021.wav|29|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_420.wav|38|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_036.wav|5|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_273.wav|68|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_125.wav|75|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_080.wav|35|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_378.wav|2|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_314.wav|85|We told them in July.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_337.wav|43|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_230.wav|63|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_241.wav|74|Government funding is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_400.wav|39|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_020.wav|65|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p307/p307_171.wav|22|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_229.wav|19|It does not take much.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_260.wav|83|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_005.wav|59|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_313.wav|96|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_370.wav|16|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_147.wav|107|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_007.wav|73|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_263.wav|7|I was just a kid.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_226.wav|62|Such a city does not exist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_351.wav|93|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_029.wav|55|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_139.wav|58|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_141.wav|88|New investment will be openly tendered.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_173.wav|66|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_329.wav|8|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_269.wav|39|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_342.wav|17|I don't expect to see that this time.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_233.wav|93|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_425.wav|36|That's the way it works.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_312.wav|62|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_146.wav|90|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_040.wav|55|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_053.wav|73|They are real.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_090.wav|38|Mr Miller is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_039.wav|62|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_136.wav|14|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_063.wav|18|I am not retaining him.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_239.wav|40|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_332.wav|55|Someone should tell them.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_395.wav|20|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_072.wav|55|That is not possible.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_067.wav|20|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_126.wav|6|he announced his plans.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_341.wav|43|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_120.wav|22|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_253.wav|48|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_142.wav|47|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_202.wav|87|It is all to do with the coaching.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_008.wav|94|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_215.wav|22|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_217.wav|63|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_195.wav|18|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_316.wav|25|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_080.wav|102|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_240.wav|60|And what happens?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_038.wav|9|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_106.wav|89|Our position remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_316.wav|35|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_345.wav|34|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_223.wav|96|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_224.wav|79|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_067.wav|41|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_172.wav|103|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_304.wav|86|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_326.wav|96|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_290.wav|45|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_189.wav|107|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_185.wav|39|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_357.wav|25|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_207.wav|49|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_097.wav|85|I hope it comes out all right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_232.wav|65|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_397.wav|79|He was too good for me - too consistent.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_168.wav|28|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_361.wav|2|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_288.wav|13|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_355.wav|38|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_334.wav|8|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_001.wav|18|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_381.wav|7|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_191.wav|35|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_324.wav|42|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_170.wav|91|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_163.wav|35|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_223.wav|1|I think it is a great idea.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_148.wav|4|This is in a league of its own.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_110.wav|47|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_164.wav|96|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_090.wav|16|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_349.wav|0|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_058.wav|55|I agree with you about this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_230.wav|59|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_167.wav|98|I can't do anything before nine.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_069.wav|7|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_118.wav|49|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_367.wav|16|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_211.wav|23|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_168.wav|10|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_036.wav|90|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_172.wav|101|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_040.wav|47|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_362.wav|63|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_125.wav|21|But it's been kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_162.wav|8|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_402.wav|74|It wants them to go home.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_079.wav|55|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_018.wav|102|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_230.wav|38|So far they have refused.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_128.wav|105|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_257.wav|72|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_268.wav|100|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_264.wav|56|This will look at consumer attitudes.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_059.wav|51|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_162.wav|2|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_473.wav|75|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_183.wav|107|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_060.wav|75|I have proved that in the past.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_093.wav|68|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_232.wav|12|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_311.wav|83|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_164.wav|24|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_087.wav|73|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_043.wav|1|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_062.wav|103|I am still pretty young in this business.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_332.wav|77|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_297.wav|79|They went back to the seventeenth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_066.wav|50|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_111.wav|15|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_094.wav|107|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_264.wav|4|All the children on the roll are genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_238.wav|102|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_281.wav|41|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_010.wav|102|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_001.wav|3|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_028.wav|51|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_094.wav|89|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_075.wav|35|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_371.wav|97|I am so lucky for that.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_002.wav|52|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_213.wav|84|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_258.wav|77|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_277.wav|63|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_122.wav|38|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_260.wav|50|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_380.wav|28|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_203.wav|5|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_121.wav|84|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_127.wav|77|I miss the freedom that I had.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_135.wav|84|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_160.wav|82|And so they have.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_253.wav|103|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_320.wav|59|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_251.wav|105|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_387.wav|102|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_324.wav|60|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_413.wav|96|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_206.wav|31|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_116.wav|73|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_342.wav|61|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_318.wav|18|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_108.wav|80|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_199.wav|92|My intentions are to go on like this.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_051.wav|22|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_188.wav|62|I probably would have been a dancer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_140.wav|61|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_330.wav|94|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_287.wav|37|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_331.wav|29|I'm not worried about the critics.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_297.wav|6|I want to make a difference.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_271.wav|74|They made up for it on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_156.wav|38|He was not deterred.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_009.wav|24|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_208.wav|92|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_276.wav|42|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_006.wav|54|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_252.wav|77|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_363.wav|66|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_008.wav|40|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_413.wav|56|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_095.wav|54|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_121.wav|103|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_180.wav|64|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_137.wav|50|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_219.wav|0|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_254.wav|63|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_142.wav|66|They are still going to be impulsive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_144.wav|74|How did he know?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_069.wav|99|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_071.wav|22|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_422.wav|6|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_220.wav|31|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_247.wav|59|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_352.wav|22|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_101.wav|10|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_372.wav|26|I thought he was my friend.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_020.wav|54|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_232.wav|26|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_004.wav|52|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_197.wav|50|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_037.wav|87|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_112.wav|98|That is how we will be judged.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_252.wav|27|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_038.wav|20|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_087.wav|27|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_105.wav|103|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_095.wav|40|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_093.wav|7|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_212.wav|29|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_189.wav|60|Maintain the highest standards.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_312.wav|4|We have not given up on the game.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_202.wav|6|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_322.wav|94|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_386.wav|13|He is just a wonderful actor.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_360.wav|93|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_381.wav|6|The challenge is to win a cup.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_276.wav|24|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_064.wav|67|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_305.wav|70|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_154.wav|57|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_245.wav|86|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_312.wav|65|They might surprise themselves.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_387.wav|35|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_285.wav|78|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_176.wav|43|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_301.wav|102|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_105.wav|88|This is a horrible loss.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_377.wav|92|I'm astonished by this decision.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_218.wav|21|If he leaves, the band is finished.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_456.wav|8|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_287.wav|71|"That could change."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_205.wav|63|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_308.wav|20|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_004.wav|12|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_102.wav|94|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_225.wav|91|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_213.wav|61|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_411.wav|13|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_102.wav|48|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_078.wav|30|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_251.wav|100|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_095.wav|95|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_217.wav|73|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_252.wav|20|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_356.wav|96|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_276.wav|53|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_320.wav|10|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_096.wav|93|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_378.wav|102|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_047.wav|5|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_254.wav|16|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_035.wav|36|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_278.wav|66|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_408.wav|95|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_376.wav|74|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_010.wav|15|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_003.wav|60|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_386.wav|58|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_237.wav|78|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_018.wav|91|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_008.wav|70|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_211.wav|43|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_088.wav|55|That remains the same.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_090.wav|88|Nature will not find its own level.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_156.wav|107|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_366.wav|10|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_222.wav|50|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_010.wav|70|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_244.wav|99|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_074.wav|70|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_379.wav|63|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_325.wav|83|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_196.wav|104|I want a career.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_201.wav|56|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_279.wav|50|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_050.wav|2|It's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_379.wav|69|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_189.wav|2|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_046.wav|11|It is so out of character.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_338.wav|14|It was an achievement all right.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_370.wav|82|I don't believe a word of it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_155.wav|91|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_375.wav|107|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_207.wav|96|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_114.wav|35|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_170.wav|20|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_308.wav|64|I think that could work to our advantage.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_077.wav|71|"This is the way things should be handled."
DUMMY2/p237/p237_003.wav|61|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_247.wav|52|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_103.wav|76|Although, you never know.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_320.wav|83|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_025.wav|29|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_294.wav|39|It will always be the highlight of my career.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_099.wav|70|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_084.wav|93|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_038.wav|62|This is really good news for us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_231.wav|89|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_175.wav|94|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_162.wav|14|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_209.wav|104|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_009.wav|98|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_109.wav|93|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_015.wav|66|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_305.wav|107|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_013.wav|32|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p351/p351_230.wav|33|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_292.wav|44|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_147.wav|28|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_047.wav|6|This has come as a shock to everyone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_393.wav|13|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_244.wav|98|I believe in theatre.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_150.wav|3|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_193.wav|78|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_184.wav|66|It's the whole season.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_069.wav|47|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_227.wav|61|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_353.wav|106|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p258/p258_254.wav|26|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_189.wav|100|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_217.wav|86|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_054.wav|88|There is no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_058.wav|89|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_115.wav|41|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_351.wav|99|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_241.wav|91|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_324.wav|58|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_084.wav|70|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_072.wav|72|That is completely against Islam.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_258.wav|38|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_037.wav|86|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_227.wav|100|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_159.wav|0|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_108.wav|60|We opened up and everything was gone.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_286.wav|32|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_030.wav|54|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_167.wav|61|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_021.wav|98|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_310.wav|96|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_391.wav|1|He was located after going to Singapore.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_163.wav|106|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_359.wav|49|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_360.wav|4|What does he want him to look like?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_199.wav|15|We know the quality of life goes up.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_277.wav|98|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_035.wav|10|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_119.wav|57|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_336.wav|0|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_001.wav|4|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_242.wav|106|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_273.wav|105|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_133.wav|40|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_254.wav|87|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_179.wav|15|What was that all about?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_199.wav|101|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_013.wav|59|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_311.wav|11|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_352.wav|17|It is now time for justice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_115.wav|52|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_335.wav|60|That is a tragedy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_095.wav|29|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_055.wav|39|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_078.wav|92|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_143.wav|97|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_052.wav|81|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_231.wav|46|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_033.wav|63|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_069.wav|17|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_253.wav|94|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_184.wav|77|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_012.wav|51|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_256.wav|85|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_390.wav|37|It's difficult to put a date on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_292.wav|86|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_054.wav|73|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_024.wav|100|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_140.wav|25|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_358.wav|7|I didn't have the reply.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_224.wav|98|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_298.wav|80|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_065.wav|28|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_104.wav|54|It was a wilful act of violence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_171.wav|30|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_150.wav|43|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_122.wav|43|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_070.wav|21|That is really all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_065.wav|21|I'm just delighted to take it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_234.wav|42|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_117.wav|71|"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_375.wav|20|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_225.wav|85|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_195.wav|19|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_083.wav|64|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_328.wav|101|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_023.wav|102|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_269.wav|74|That, though, is not true.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_257.wav|1|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_182.wav|28|It would be really interesting if they did.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_316.wav|75|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_019.wav|29|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_329.wav|0|It's not an easy life.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_100.wav|96|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_182.wav|22|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_089.wav|72|My back is feeling really good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_051.wav|89|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_016.wav|106|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_011.wav|73|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_040.wav|0|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_224.wav|74|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_130.wav|90|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_133.wav|26|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_244.wav|44|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_365.wav|31|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_037.wav|76|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_343.wav|51|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_218.wav|66|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_418.wav|74|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_187.wav|84|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_267.wav|42|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_419.wav|98|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_135.wav|87|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_365.wav|42|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_152.wav|60|Our time is up.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_322.wav|2|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_090.wav|106|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_271.wav|35|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_397.wav|65|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_187.wav|0|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_099.wav|92|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_491.wav|24|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_360.wav|106|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_049.wav|78|That is still the case.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_163.wav|94|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_392.wav|100|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_336.wav|73|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_273.wav|77|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_403.wav|52|These old songs are very nice to play.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_156.wav|98|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_067.wav|34|Most of the others were in their twenties.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_124.wav|90|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_003.wav|78|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_089.wav|5|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_460.wav|50|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_173.wav|84|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_420.wav|50|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_091.wav|104|There's a strong involvement.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_413.wav|104|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_342.wav|106|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_129.wav|35|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_095.wav|75|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_062.wav|14|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_335.wav|31|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_365.wav|99|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_266.wav|11|I am expecting to win.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_175.wav|5|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_038.wav|104|Their ambition is to go back.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_306.wav|21|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_108.wav|70|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_198.wav|19|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_081.wav|101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_341.wav|97|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_411.wav|72|But it was money well spent.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_355.wav|31|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_041.wav|31|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_084.wav|59|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_027.wav|34|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_395.wav|6|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_217.wav|42|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_373.wav|58|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_355.wav|82|Everything is up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_138.wav|76|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_102.wav|91|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_165.wav|102|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_155.wav|12|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_017.wav|18|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_195.wav|42|Scots actors should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_301.wav|19|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_325.wav|85|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_226.wav|33|Perhaps it was just as well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_398.wav|68|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_321.wav|96|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_048.wav|55|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_407.wav|24|My immune system had been depleted.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_301.wav|100|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_186.wav|11|No-one has ever seen inside.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_088.wav|84|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_245.wav|75|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_154.wav|60|But other Ministers are not convinced.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_413.wav|48|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_071.wav|89|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_344.wav|40|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_177.wav|20|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_380.wav|94|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_174.wav|7|Adventure is the champagne of life.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_098.wav|19|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_114.wav|103|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_359.wav|13|There's no choice is there?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_078.wav|83|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_320.wav|77|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_011.wav|20|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_241.wav|65|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_105.wav|23|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_319.wav|36|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_311.wav|93|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_073.wav|68|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_242.wav|98|The English are coming.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_082.wav|38|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_344.wav|105|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_029.wav|68|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_200.wav|100|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_232.wav|31|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_032.wav|64|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_274.wav|75|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_289.wav|93|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_276.wav|14|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_018.wav|61|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_297.wav|105|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_027.wav|70|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_076.wav|59|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_323.wav|96|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_074.wav|94|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_321.wav|81|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_164.wav|99|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_032.wav|78|The end result is the same.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_309.wav|43|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_030.wav|106|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_383.wav|91|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_211.wav|11|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_159.wav|14|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_103.wav|94|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_133.wav|11|Players want to know what is on offer.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_278.wav|83|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_130.wav|23|They have their own interests and techniques.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_400.wav|54|A review group will report on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_077.wav|104|It will not be a long campaign.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_388.wav|21|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_128.wav|12|She says the royal family get on well.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_447.wav|39|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_025.wav|69|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_132.wav|59|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_090.wav|77|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_411.wav|26|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_169.wav|20|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_016.wav|40|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_311.wav|31|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_395.wav|37|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_233.wav|5|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_425.wav|65|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_233.wav|21|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_011.wav|91|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_014.wav|55|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_058.wav|53|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_150.wav|36|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_409.wav|7|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_213.wav|15|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_376.wav|11|I want to get at the truth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_053.wav|82|I could never be cool.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_262.wav|76|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_333.wav|11|What is that?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_102.wav|31|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_238.wav|11|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_357.wav|75|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_169.wav|5|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_376.wav|75|All would be under threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_401.wav|27|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_079.wav|44|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_221.wav|30|They make it look very easy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_097.wav|106|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_312.wav|13|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_039.wav|63|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_378.wav|78|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_291.wav|38|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_197.wav|2|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_261.wav|69|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_392.wav|104|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_304.wav|33|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_110.wav|107|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_250.wav|99|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_029.wav|17|Did you see that?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_206.wav|58|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_055.wav|97|New potential dangers were emerging.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_357.wav|68|I would urge the Government to think again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_391.wav|69|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_157.wav|64|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_065.wav|100|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_117.wav|41|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_127.wav|92|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_300.wav|60|Is it all real?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_048.wav|77|The teacher would have approved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_400.wav|96|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_254.wav|25|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_050.wav|85|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_286.wav|48|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_287.wav|23|They certainly do not socialise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_171.wav|16|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_064.wav|3|It was an amazing result.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_380.wav|46|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_042.wav|3|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_314.wav|70|It will work.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_211.wav|29|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_333.wav|102|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_087.wav|82|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_061.wav|22|That is why we want this decision reversed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_221.wav|77|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_162.wav|103|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_353.wav|104|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_121.wav|60|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_247.wav|35|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_364.wav|20|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_315.wav|50|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_280.wav|57|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_087.wav|53|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_202.wav|80|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_287.wav|16|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p266/p266_314.wav|20|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_395.wav|11|I just don't know what she was doing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_332.wav|92|I'm sure that they will learn.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_214.wav|72|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_169.wav|16|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_296.wav|57|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_422.wav|64|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_094.wav|10|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_231.wav|102|We have tried to keep his head up.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_169.wav|101|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_197.wav|13|This is my homeland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_330.wav|89|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_296.wav|9|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_417.wav|16|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_321.wav|79|You have to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_022.wav|68|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_119.wav|64|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_074.wav|33|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_354.wav|11|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_140.wav|80|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_397.wav|33|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_376.wav|106|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_046.wav|6|That is good news.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_204.wav|95|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_065.wav|95|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_086.wav|95|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_349.wav|7|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_292.wav|13|Spent three months alone at sea.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_355.wav|23|But it can happen for Tiger.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_254.wav|95|Our future is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_398.wav|23|Their bid was a very good one.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_409.wav|72|We are not too surprised.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_158.wav|43|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_056.wav|51|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_041.wav|48|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_198.wav|30|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_424.wav|19|We have no plans for direct action.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_005.wav|10|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_225.wav|44|It did my image a lot of good!
DUMMY2/p347/p347_212.wav|46|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_038.wav|84|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_370.wav|46|It's an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_201.wav|76|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_339.wav|54|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_029.wav|33|It is my fault.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_461.wav|89|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_371.wav|104|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_378.wav|98|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_208.wav|76|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_182.wav|18|You'll find out on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_135.wav|25|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_234.wav|67|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_333.wav|98|He pretended not to care.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_347.wav|100|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_414.wav|22|Now you see him, now you don't.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_309.wav|34|I don't want to hear any excuses.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_218.wav|24|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_013.wav|25|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_029.wav|16|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_408.wav|14|But they can also be managed by telephone.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_382.wav|27|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_086.wav|73|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_023.wav|99|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_292.wav|24|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_341.wav|29|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_347.wav|85|People are using it in their daily lives.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_270.wav|79|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_376.wav|72|They say they feel different.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_058.wav|92|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_421.wav|85|The British government said she was coming home.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_158.wav|94|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_053.wav|19|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_050.wav|78|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_390.wav|36|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_225.wav|26|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_084.wav|27|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_059.wav|49|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_308.wav|53|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_298.wav|42|After that, we made some changes.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_011.wav|64|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_033.wav|80|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_379.wav|36|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_406.wav|16|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_366.wav|21|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_090.wav|52|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_337.wav|65|The regional government faces key elections next May.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_003.wav|38|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_331.wav|63|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_271.wav|41|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_334.wav|95|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_262.wav|49|Intensive care has been very busy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_157.wav|4|He was part of South Africa.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_049.wav|15|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_288.wav|77|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_036.wav|16|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_154.wav|21|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_068.wav|65|That is not possible.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_012.wav|60|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_095.wav|26|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_315.wav|21|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_120.wav|82|Neither of them was badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_165.wav|26|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_184.wav|61|This is a sad day.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_165.wav|68|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_230.wav|87|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_234.wav|65|However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_235.wav|88|They were assured that it would.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_123.wav|74|Yes, we can beat them.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_256.wav|18|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_324.wav|15|I think she was right.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_078.wav|82|I have nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_329.wav|31|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_151.wav|43|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_253.wav|88|But this is just the first step.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_001.wav|9|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_272.wav|6|We're going to fight it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_246.wav|38|He was to get his chance.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_107.wav|80|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_120.wav|84|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_347.wav|97|We don't believe anything anymore.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_021.wav|95|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_275.wav|31|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_117.wav|16|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_413.wav|13|The balance is all wrong in this country.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_157.wav|75|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_018.wav|19|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_079.wav|37|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_088.wav|27|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_306.wav|42|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_295.wav|38|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_086.wav|41|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_056.wav|104|This is a possible way forward.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_014.wav|83|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_422.wav|74|Our policy is already working well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_060.wav|18|But what did it matter?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_063.wav|55|It was dangerous but vital employment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_377.wav|45|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_303.wav|47|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_327.wav|15|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_121.wav|53|They have no real friends in the region.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_238.wav|41|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_198.wav|59|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_037.wav|58|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_059.wav|35|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_079.wav|86|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_224.wav|66|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_207.wav|50|You've caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_311.wav|68|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_269.wav|15|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_294.wav|104|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_152.wav|106|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_358.wav|83|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_252.wav|26|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_354.wav|18|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_136.wav|75|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_303.wav|48|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_324.wav|92|It will not work in our favour.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_225.wav|13|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_271.wav|91|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_233.wav|99|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_005.wav|105|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_004.wav|89|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_252.wav|50|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_039.wav|12|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_068.wav|45|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_399.wav|58|Scotland is losing business.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_026.wav|64|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_274.wav|92|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_294.wav|102|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_072.wav|101|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_222.wav|75|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_112.wav|47|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_273.wav|45|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_048.wav|24|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_337.wav|100|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_124.wav|92|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_296.wav|69|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_336.wav|1|Will he be given time?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_187.wav|14|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_400.wav|40|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_291.wav|92|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_356.wav|7|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_268.wav|6|The test case is still awaiting action.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_350.wav|3|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_049.wav|14|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_161.wav|35|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_330.wav|51|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_049.wav|72|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_344.wav|49|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_192.wav|35|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_346.wav|40|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_183.wav|38|That is his attitude to things.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_141.wav|65|That comes at a cost.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_184.wav|52|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_193.wav|98|This is the start of a slippery slope.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_145.wav|40|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_082.wav|94|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_182.wav|42|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_399.wav|47|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_102.wav|95|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_228.wav|87|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_083.wav|86|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_057.wav|39|It will now take over the running of the estate.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_410.wav|92|To me, it was just a miracle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_084.wav|80|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_315.wav|90|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_042.wav|36|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_352.wav|107|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_327.wav|7|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_103.wav|78|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_327.wav|107|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_301.wav|45|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_417.wav|1|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_286.wav|64|That's why he plays for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_141.wav|16|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_147.wav|10|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_041.wav|88|We welcome the ministers decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_117.wav|6|These people are helpless.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_264.wav|44|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_030.wav|105|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_282.wav|89|It was good.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_084.wav|45|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_256.wav|43|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_421.wav|105|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_207.wav|62|Let us hope so.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_136.wav|3|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_156.wav|13|If only the acting profession was that simple.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_270.wav|75|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_443.wav|100|It is a case of pity for us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_053.wav|71|"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress."
DUMMY2/p267/p267_161.wav|0|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_246.wav|75|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_177.wav|107|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_165.wav|2|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_372.wav|35|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_176.wav|106|It took five months to repair the damage.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_115.wav|35|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_340.wav|79|They are used to it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_093.wav|64|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_242.wav|10|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_156.wav|27|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_176.wav|22|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_194.wav|37|He has had success at every level.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_190.wav|27|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_060.wav|60|But there is no easy option.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_065.wav|59|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_295.wav|107|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_222.wav|107|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_114.wav|66|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_211.wav|98|And how much of a compliment is that?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_279.wav|99|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_235.wav|1|That is the first thing we need.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_183.wav|19|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_411.wav|33|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_118.wav|4|It is already making a difference.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_447.wav|75|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_091.wav|74|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_345.wav|4|I feel it's time to make the switch.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_134.wav|97|We took the chances when they came.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_379.wav|35|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_287.wav|6|I believe he could have turned it around.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_064.wav|6|The club is afflicted by injuries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_076.wav|49|He had a moustache.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_144.wav|81|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_187.wav|98|Cloning is not ready.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_062.wav|46|The message is just not getting through.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_167.wav|79|The omens are not good.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_198.wav|58|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_123.wav|38|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_268.wav|60|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_269.wav|32|No production contract is yet in sight.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_369.wav|1|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_079.wav|31|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_115.wav|66|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_089.wav|7|What do we do ?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_283.wav|107|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_014.wav|56|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_244.wav|53|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_001.wav|11|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_404.wav|75|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_295.wav|5|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p278/p278_081.wav|10|That was a great performance by the team.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_031.wav|39|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_364.wav|16|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_282.wav|67|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_155.wav|47|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_122.wav|88|This decision is a victory for common sense.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_124.wav|102|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_314.wav|56|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_087.wav|19|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_100.wav|34|But he is something special, is he not?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_341.wav|37|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_387.wav|76|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_347.wav|103|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_013.wav|96|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_160.wav|103|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_328.wav|74|And the audience is a surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_175.wav|12|You cannot eat in the dining room.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_179.wav|32|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_126.wav|11|They went to the press.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_161.wav|75|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_428.wav|89|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_117.wav|57|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_268.wav|103|Now that was a boxing movie.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_135.wav|38|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_374.wav|75|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_150.wav|4|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_282.wav|91|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_283.wav|21|It may take time to get it back.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_034.wav|33|Teachers have been given the offer.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_073.wav|0|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_367.wav|74|I love it here.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_456.wav|32|They offer a kind of narrative.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_394.wav|107|His condition was stable last night.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_158.wav|23|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_256.wav|31|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_096.wav|86|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p361/p361_358.wav|79|If only it had been.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_182.wav|48|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_255.wav|46|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_186.wav|66|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_379.wav|51|There were three boys and two girls.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_043.wav|99|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_199.wav|82|I know my sons.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_272.wav|37|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_004.wav|14|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p282/p282_066.wav|83|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_035.wav|42|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_005.wav|34|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_262.wav|88|It would be a bonus for this game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_327.wav|76|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_195.wav|29|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_358.wav|75|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_219.wav|1|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_407.wav|91|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_191.wav|63|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_245.wav|50|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_389.wav|24|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_280.wav|51|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_211.wav|102|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_334.wav|46|That is as it may be.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_046.wav|52|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_266.wav|8|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_096.wav|36|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_156.wav|55|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_375.wav|25|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_320.wav|97|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_444.wav|48|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_288.wav|41|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_033.wav|90|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_152.wav|44|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_398.wav|32|Finally, he paid for the movie.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_204.wav|4|I'm very frightened of the dark.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_093.wav|53|They had the appeal of TV stars.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_128.wav|13|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_235.wav|36|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_095.wav|14|Potions said he would drive.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_253.wav|21|There were too many mistakes.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_394.wav|72|He just attracted people.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_268.wav|86|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_195.wav|43|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_341.wav|87|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_231.wav|5|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_191.wav|68|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_383.wav|1|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_307.wav|36|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_074.wav|96|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_136.wav|51|Folk music is in her blood.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_020.wav|38|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_225.wav|89|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_410.wav|37|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_059.wav|17|This is the band.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_048.wav|37|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_188.wav|52|I didn't miss the big house at all.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_034.wav|28|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_025.wav|106|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_202.wav|38|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_282.wav|73|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_405.wav|95|There is a lack of logic.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_065.wav|92|Can you imagine a world without design?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_187.wav|1|He went to see what he could learn.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_065.wav|81|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_186.wav|12|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_293.wav|6|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_016.wav|93|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_309.wav|92|They told him to go to drama school.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_356.wav|42|The course record was in his name.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_330.wav|78|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_447.wav|106|We go there with confidence.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_289.wav|73|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_323.wav|18|It wasn't the issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_448.wav|95|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_069.wav|43|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_314.wav|0|I will not be afraid.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_048.wav|27|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_424.wav|40|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_124.wav|63|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_036.wav|70|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_114.wav|6|I hope the couples are still together.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_200.wav|72|This guy is amazing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_094.wav|0|It's not a lack of effort.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_150.wav|26|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_410.wav|14|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_338.wav|25|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_133.wav|101|I think he's the favourite.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_384.wav|106|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_010.wav|73|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_016.wav|48|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_270.wav|93|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_422.wav|36|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_398.wav|63|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_251.wav|10|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_301.wav|78|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_330.wav|16|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_053.wav|66|It's to do with play.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_182.wav|64|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_235.wav|33|I am very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_197.wav|96|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_155.wav|107|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_042.wav|75|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_309.wav|68|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_396.wav|79|They thought they couldn't get any.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_193.wav|9|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_355.wav|47|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_399.wav|69|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_149.wav|2|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_378.wav|16|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_315.wav|7|It's hard to see it.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_263.wav|95|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_134.wav|25|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_227.wav|35|It was a day for records.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_354.wav|37|They're going to open in early summer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_216.wav|50|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_068.wav|42|We will be paying agency rates.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_122.wav|49|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_151.wav|97|The driver escaped injury.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_015.wav|39|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_127.wav|82|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_347.wav|80|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_291.wav|11|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_086.wav|100|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_148.wav|31|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_028.wav|46|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_046.wav|107|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_019.wav|75|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_260.wav|102|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_238.wav|45|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_242.wav|59|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_069.wav|90|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_032.wav|90|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_008.wav|36|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_019.wav|104|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_222.wav|97|But Harry has become a franchise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_305.wav|92|Nobody will be forced to work.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_191.wav|49|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_274.wav|77|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_040.wav|28|The police believe the man was not injured.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_180.wav|5|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_365.wav|53|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_309.wav|7|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_035.wav|12|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_312.wav|58|Why should we have been asked to share?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_004.wav|10|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_377.wav|35|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_219.wav|89|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_318.wav|15|It is good news for us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_053.wav|65|It was dangerous but vital employment.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_242.wav|20|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_189.wav|65|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_023.wav|79|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_252.wav|52|The rise has come too late for some.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_165.wav|79|He tells the truth and that's important.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_077.wav|33|Clearly it is very disturbing.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_282.wav|57|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_214.wav|102|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_046.wav|94|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_418.wav|64|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_162.wav|71|"It was so new, so exciting."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_419.wav|105|It's not about defining styles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_257.wav|9|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_256.wav|60|They were all on a mission.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_318.wav|21|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_166.wav|7|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_286.wav|68|We have been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_156.wav|54|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_044.wav|15|This is only one example.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_068.wav|107|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_401.wav|77|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_063.wav|5|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_305.wav|90|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_112.wav|36|The whole thing is the music.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_092.wav|1|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_226.wav|54|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_329.wav|99|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_340.wav|91|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_353.wav|21|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_055.wav|44|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_132.wav|12|I've always been desperate to play this part.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_210.wav|106|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_263.wav|71|"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales."
DUMMY2/p304/p304_093.wav|72|But we are losing that connection.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_263.wav|102|That means no more taxation by stealth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_108.wav|82|Would you pay to come and see it?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_392.wav|22|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_088.wav|69|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_098.wav|103|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_186.wav|13|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_310.wav|9|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_044.wav|67|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_146.wav|35|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_048.wav|78|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_120.wav|18|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_311.wav|19|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_153.wav|13|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_091.wav|33|We have a rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_242.wav|42|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_253.wav|13|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_111.wav|47|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_146.wav|92|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_244.wav|31|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_273.wav|16|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_153.wav|80|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_145.wav|58|This has a number of benefits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_258.wav|105|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_003.wav|37|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_029.wav|15|It was a fairy tale.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_221.wav|2|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_242.wav|41|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_071.wav|16|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_249.wav|21|It's still got that at its heart.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_101.wav|36|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_191.wav|100|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_029.wav|5|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_055.wav|30|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_419.wav|72|I can understand why they have gone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_046.wav|39|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_025.wav|15|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_381.wav|104|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_006.wav|17|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_010.wav|90|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_164.wav|18|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_021.wav|99|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_353.wav|49|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_135.wav|37|No one person or small group could be singled out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_358.wav|11|It's for that reason he should resign.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_472.wav|14|And it covers the spectrum.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_235.wav|20|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_041.wav|40|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_161.wav|43|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_183.wav|96|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_147.wav|53|You should feel involved in their lives.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_249.wav|25|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_067.wav|91|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_231.wav|84|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_231.wav|68|I fell in love with ballet.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_275.wav|38|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_044.wav|40|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_425.wav|27|He is to appeal.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_321.wav|17|But both were involved with other matters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_164.wav|73|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_111.wav|89|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_227.wav|82|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_384.wav|20|It's like a car crash.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_362.wav|83|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_206.wav|17|I think it's awful.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_296.wav|26|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_323.wav|77|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_075.wav|95|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_294.wav|88|When he got up he was hit again.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_378.wav|35|We are a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_380.wav|85|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_220.wav|71|"At the time, he was a living legend."
DUMMY2/p247/p247_290.wav|14|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_043.wav|16|We will push.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_363.wav|4|We would have concerns about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_135.wav|97|It is important that vital services are maintained.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_016.wav|73|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_257.wav|50|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_308.wav|57|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_145.wav|17|Is that too much to ask?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_175.wav|83|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_047.wav|105|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_362.wav|20|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_014.wav|11|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_191.wav|76|We have understood the problems for some time.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_064.wav|101|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_198.wav|18|I have no problem with that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_091.wav|83|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_107.wav|5|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_089.wav|14|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_202.wav|67|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_065.wav|46|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_234.wav|37|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_338.wav|21|He didn't let me down.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_367.wav|35|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_128.wav|83|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_162.wav|39|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_198.wav|97|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_371.wav|26|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_183.wav|53|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_344.wav|32|No one wants a dispute.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_395.wav|105|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_203.wav|76|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_194.wav|48|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_282.wav|58|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_075.wav|86|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_327.wav|95|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_294.wav|106|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_231.wav|28|They made it very difficult for us.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_163.wav|95|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_361.wav|29|A report is expected next month.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_070.wav|5|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_326.wav|14|I thought his speech was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_208.wav|33|They are not a set of options.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_060.wav|93|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_378.wav|55|The referee faces a massive job.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_022.wav|52|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_299.wav|41|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_420.wav|40|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_153.wav|21|Only one got through.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_378.wav|10|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_071.wav|17|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_120.wav|35|They are very happy with the new settlement.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_064.wav|0|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_290.wav|48|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_282.wav|63|That will be a problem for later.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_123.wav|88|One is too many.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_273.wav|13|The issues are very intense.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_216.wav|87|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_135.wav|13|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p281/p281_398.wav|36|He had returned to die.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_122.wav|74|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_381.wav|95|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_137.wav|93|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_210.wav|40|You have a plan?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_001.wav|37|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_165.wav|44|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_164.wav|77|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_377.wav|105|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_258.wav|60|You will gain from that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_081.wav|1|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_236.wav|31|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_209.wav|71|"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland."
DUMMY2/p226/p226_048.wav|43|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_311.wav|63|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_086.wav|106|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_191.wav|93|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_359.wav|76|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_061.wav|69|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_101.wav|83|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_204.wav|37|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_342.wav|42|Don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_192.wav|6|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_184.wav|81|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_171.wav|12|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_392.wav|55|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_112.wav|29|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_397.wav|52|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_125.wav|26|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_245.wav|98|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_171.wav|43|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_070.wav|22|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_007.wav|10|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_261.wav|5|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_234.wav|62|It was worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_332.wav|80|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_031.wav|47|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_317.wav|39|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_017.wav|2|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_068.wav|23|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_371.wav|100|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_233.wav|77|This is a family club.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_408.wav|60|What was all that about?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_071.wav|98|The hearing was continued until a later date.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_116.wav|58|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_029.wav|51|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_009.wav|28|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_381.wav|24|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_304.wav|51|This club have been fair to me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_382.wav|76|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_289.wav|31|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_282.wav|11|He did very well, but didn't win.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_405.wav|69|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_225.wav|74|You have to keep it on the fairways.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_487.wav|65|Her father wasn't best pleased.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_191.wav|75|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_249.wav|2|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_032.wav|88|It is not a matter of concern.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_183.wav|16|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_379.wav|32|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_244.wav|57|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_228.wav|85|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_159.wav|39|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_373.wav|40|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_138.wav|88|It's not their fault.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_085.wav|65|We're at home, which is important.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_088.wav|59|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_091.wav|32|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_375.wav|68|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_390.wav|8|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_120.wav|77|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_253.wav|60|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_104.wav|12|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_215.wav|94|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_387.wav|22|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_409.wav|104|Such is the ego involved.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_114.wav|3|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_319.wav|94|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_313.wav|51|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_369.wav|64|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_056.wav|47|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_407.wav|48|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_063.wav|44|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_138.wav|83|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_001.wav|85|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_276.wav|29|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_171.wav|36|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_057.wav|36|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_435.wav|65|It all came good.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_007.wav|0|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_006.wav|44|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_208.wav|91|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_090.wav|41|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_052.wav|8|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_386.wav|42|We've been calling for a level playing field.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_232.wav|34|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_057.wav|22|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_426.wav|75|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_041.wav|85|There is a new confidence about the club.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_385.wav|21|It almost certainly is.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_177.wav|11|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_213.wav|90|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_054.wav|1|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_020.wav|36|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_349.wav|3|We are not interested in dividends.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_334.wav|59|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_427.wav|36|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_261.wav|96|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_423.wav|95|I was pleased with my own game.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_238.wav|20|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_211.wav|100|I chose to go by the rules.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_042.wav|11|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_145.wav|91|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_369.wav|15|We thought we were looking in good shape.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_341.wav|2|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_015.wav|28|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_236.wav|59|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_074.wav|22|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_261.wav|6|They may not always be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_214.wav|97|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_092.wav|7|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_256.wav|64|We started from scratch.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_129.wav|22|We now have to concentrate on the league.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_386.wav|68|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_270.wav|31|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_268.wav|55|But the next day she paid for it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_116.wav|55|They need the money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_273.wav|29|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_199.wav|55|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_273.wav|24|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_245.wav|22|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_158.wav|20|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_230.wav|80|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_357.wav|81|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_303.wav|88|It was then that Rangers scored.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_115.wav|17|There is no guarantee.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_244.wav|55|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_078.wav|57|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_075.wav|87|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_321.wav|104|We know we have done wrong.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_032.wav|94|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_047.wav|72|It is not about changing our image.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_100.wav|18|He is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_203.wav|41|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_187.wav|96|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_331.wav|57|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_038.wav|69|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_149.wav|58|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_194.wav|85|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_344.wav|44|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_159.wav|28|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_005.wav|7|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p308/p308_339.wav|107|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_286.wav|8|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_219.wav|106|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_032.wav|9|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_398.wav|22|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_340.wav|100|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_125.wav|86|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_095.wav|0|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_239.wav|3|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_388.wav|64|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_247.wav|74|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_359.wav|0|We live on an island.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_026.wav|15|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_117.wav|9|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_369.wav|51|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_274.wav|79|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_441.wav|14|There is no hiding place.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_102.wav|93|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_420.wav|92|But, of course, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_007.wav|65|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_246.wav|15|He said nothing of the sort.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_110.wav|21|It's up to them to decide.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_349.wav|5|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_215.wav|4|It wouldn't go off.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_022.wav|2|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_393.wav|75|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_039.wav|64|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_108.wav|90|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_406.wav|6|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_404.wav|22|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_086.wav|63|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_186.wav|91|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_037.wav|71|"He has not been named."
DUMMY2/p279/p279_169.wav|25|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_015.wav|54|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_019.wav|33|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_422.wav|18|There is no shortage of questions.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_093.wav|15|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_088.wav|15|They could not have done more for me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_127.wav|100|He can perform well under pressure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_363.wav|102|This is not great, but it goes well.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_012.wav|8|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_078.wav|45|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_131.wav|65|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_157.wav|80|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_331.wav|37|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p302/p302_278.wav|30|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_333.wav|46|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_270.wav|48|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_210.wav|86|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_377.wav|22|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_104.wav|22|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_214.wav|22|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_113.wav|22|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_205.wav|13|I have no conflict with them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_359.wav|59|But nothing happened.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_375.wav|28|They did not threaten anyone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_108.wav|17|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_280.wav|42|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_139.wav|72|But we have to plan for the future.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_263.wav|59|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_103.wav|81|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_249.wav|29|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_381.wav|35|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_011.wav|89|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_374.wav|92|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_329.wav|16|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_206.wav|32|I won't make an official complaint.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_032.wav|100|It was a close call.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_291.wav|26|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_088.wav|106|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_228.wav|29|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_019.wav|78|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_314.wav|73|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_007.wav|102|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_023.wav|29|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_101.wav|2|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_019.wav|16|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_271.wav|70|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_107.wav|74|That was my first reaction.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_075.wav|24|There's nothing they can get on me.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_387.wav|94|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_134.wav|20|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_075.wav|0|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_384.wav|54|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_163.wav|46|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_045.wav|68|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_209.wav|29|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_216.wav|28|You're going to take away my life.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_071.wav|4|It's not just about the shows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_114.wav|106|It is sometimes like that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_382.wav|18|Our position is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_192.wav|53|I am fighting the force of nature.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_344.wav|27|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_270.wav|0|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_003.wav|42|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_301.wav|22|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_001.wav|64|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_227.wav|59|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_318.wav|101|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_289.wav|88|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_335.wav|73|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_354.wav|72|For next season, we have time to restructure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_082.wav|100|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_181.wav|95|The research was my life.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_113.wav|73|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_272.wav|97|We are asking the council to think again.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_356.wav|79|I did not go looking anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_186.wav|62|I'm going to see my friend.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_263.wav|70|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_200.wav|16|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_153.wav|66|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_253.wav|29|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_092.wav|64|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_113.wav|6|That was certainly the case for the parties.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_338.wav|83|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_015.wav|5|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_364.wav|32|Italy was just behind the US.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_280.wav|9|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_423.wav|63|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_244.wav|95|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_351.wav|58|That's the last thing he will do.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_112.wav|26|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_160.wav|50|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_110.wav|93|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_108.wav|36|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_300.wav|11|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_328.wav|63|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_355.wav|12|I didn't even have the first idea.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_230.wav|48|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_120.wav|68|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_129.wav|91|We now have to concentrate on the league.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_262.wav|13|It should not make the same mistake again.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_348.wav|48|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_035.wav|25|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_223.wav|97|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_121.wav|27|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_341.wav|4|Things don't look too good at the moment.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_300.wav|52|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_198.wav|10|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_103.wav|31|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_249.wav|83|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_117.wav|29|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_352.wav|73|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_185.wav|57|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_211.wav|38|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_256.wav|74|It was quite simply, delicious.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_023.wav|103|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_140.wav|91|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_231.wav|80|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_218.wav|54|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_412.wav|16|It might be.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_058.wav|73|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_147.wav|96|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_076.wav|43|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_271.wav|8|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_249.wav|0|He declined to give any details.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_179.wav|72|The real world is full of competing causes.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_373.wav|86|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_343.wav|98|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_047.wav|89|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_208.wav|63|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_047.wav|26|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_343.wav|5|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_331.wav|54|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_073.wav|23|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_028.wav|49|Let's not go overboard.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_351.wav|107|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_364.wav|76|I'm amazed at what he's done.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_218.wav|17|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_286.wav|37|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_149.wav|29|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_209.wav|79|She has always been very friendly.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_216.wav|79|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_253.wav|18|We all knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_174.wav|44|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_373.wav|18|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_064.wav|52|It also has a good labour supply.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_151.wav|101|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_392.wav|11|These days are over.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_292.wav|99|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_138.wav|14|We did what we had to do.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_240.wav|22|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_264.wav|73|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_098.wav|69|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_409.wav|40|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_274.wav|97|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_311.wav|105|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_092.wav|30|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_307.wav|97|That has given me great confidence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_083.wav|7|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_353.wav|81|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_137.wav|29|Our position is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_021.wav|43|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_114.wav|30|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_359.wav|21|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_448.wav|8|No further details of expansion plans were given.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_116.wav|83|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_226.wav|79|Part-time staff are being laid off.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_261.wav|104|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_364.wav|38|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_162.wav|50|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_117.wav|14|You had better believe it.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_159.wav|9|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_178.wav|25|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_124.wav|80|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_330.wav|76|We are now in an election period.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_135.wav|7|Reaction to the device was mixed.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_335.wav|64|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_378.wav|41|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_350.wav|87|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_146.wav|55|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_406.wav|96|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_267.wav|16|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_306.wav|46|And we were right.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_266.wav|9|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_094.wav|41|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_046.wav|31|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_405.wav|13|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_475.wav|50|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_174.wav|93|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_252.wav|25|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_112.wav|83|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_397.wav|100|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_103.wav|61|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_237.wav|3|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_309.wav|30|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_412.wav|11|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_257.wav|99|They are real.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_194.wav|6|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_191.wav|18|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_133.wav|24|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_018.wav|22|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_379.wav|102|They should have some measure of protection.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_143.wav|16|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_165.wav|14|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_241.wav|3|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_060.wav|21|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_052.wav|107|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_179.wav|49|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_047.wav|3|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_122.wav|36|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_261.wav|88|It does not take much.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_124.wav|74|She was not hard done by.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_471.wav|39|That should get their attention.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_362.wav|65|Her body has never been found.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_471.wav|75|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_278.wav|72|It is my fault.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_299.wav|46|They played it like a cup final.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_056.wav|103|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_015.wav|59|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_161.wav|73|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_027.wav|78|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_335.wav|98|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_060.wav|6|What's the problem?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_332.wav|19|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_307.wav|104|Cinema is a communal experience.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_022.wav|9|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_014.wav|29|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_157.wav|43|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_241.wav|87|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_133.wav|58|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_361.wav|14|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_024.wav|97|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_164.wav|71|"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks."
DUMMY2/p317/p317_188.wav|97|This is not a birthday party.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_211.wav|74|The family baton is handed on.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_018.wav|55|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_242.wav|22|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_159.wav|51|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_293.wav|61|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_188.wav|48|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_039.wav|58|I think we have a very strong case.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_038.wav|51|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_342.wav|80|He's a genius.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_241.wav|95|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_339.wav|51|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_102.wav|61|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_037.wav|96|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_458.wav|48|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_368.wav|51|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_055.wav|26|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_034.wav|73|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_235.wav|37|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_338.wav|104|No-one else was hurt.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_074.wav|85|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_102.wav|5|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_192.wav|93|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_233.wav|27|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_174.wav|47|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_008.wav|84|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_166.wav|51|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_056.wav|19|I have really noticed that this week.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_160.wav|17|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_393.wav|25|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_197.wav|74|This was all well and good.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_176.wav|24|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_147.wav|104|She was always a quality act.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_002.wav|87|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_270.wav|104|We will work through the night.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_068.wav|54|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_349.wav|72|That is a lot of writing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_385.wav|38|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_378.wav|31|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_376.wav|66|And we all understand that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_334.wav|60|It will be up to the government.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_181.wav|83|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_144.wav|107|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_278.wav|89|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_289.wav|97|It's so creative and different.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_105.wav|84|He has become a monster.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_145.wav|2|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_059.wav|102|He was taken ill in December last year.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_188.wav|67|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_082.wav|32|We have to offer value for money.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_219.wav|21|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_432.wav|100|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_234.wav|96|But she was.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_284.wav|24|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_118.wav|45|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_251.wav|90|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_218.wav|72|That is why it is so lyrical.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_137.wav|57|Who will attend ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_068.wav|18|But summer is spent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_261.wav|11|I just want to get rid of it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_328.wav|17|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_029.wav|75|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_127.wav|1|He was part of South Africa.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_147.wav|66|There's a good chance of seeing something.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_325.wav|24|There's still no-one like him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_426.wav|106|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_180.wav|59|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_317.wav|58|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_224.wav|65|It was all great training.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_466.wav|7|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_268.wav|13|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_265.wav|74|I am very relieved.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_353.wav|18|I had nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_028.wav|12|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_289.wav|11|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_030.wav|104|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_410.wav|0|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_200.wav|0|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_358.wav|47|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_041.wav|93|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_106.wav|14|Our preference is to play in midweek.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_300.wav|16|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_364.wav|14|But we welcome this document.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_155.wav|88|It has paid off.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_379.wav|48|He did not say that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_133.wav|49|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_342.wav|79|It's just not good enough.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_220.wav|95|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_224.wav|16|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_144.wav|64|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_119.wav|58|I am happy with my form.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_269.wav|88|Or so we thought.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_395.wav|49|We have been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_305.wav|57|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_357.wav|20|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_074.wav|30|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_128.wav|30|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_359.wav|8|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_391.wav|52|My tax affairs have been totally open.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_249.wav|54|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_385.wav|4|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_134.wav|47|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_071.wav|44|The cause of the crash was unclear.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_340.wav|29|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_165.wav|31|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_132.wav|24|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_322.wav|69|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_020.wav|9|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_139.wav|75|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_111.wav|20|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_173.wav|17|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_074.wav|48|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_129.wav|54|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_091.wav|31|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_180.wav|66|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_171.wav|80|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_172.wav|30|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_392.wav|13|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_149.wav|101|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_121.wav|5|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_259.wav|68|Do you think you have a shot?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_273.wav|4|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_241.wav|77|It was a fairy tale.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_025.wav|41|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_159.wav|100|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_007.wav|84|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_245.wav|78|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_317.wav|40|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_028.wav|0|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_146.wav|89|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_316.wav|39|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_384.wav|64|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_366.wav|89|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_159.wav|19|They may differ on other issues.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_113.wav|71|"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end."
DUMMY2/p279/p279_030.wav|25|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_249.wav|78|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_226.wav|106|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_190.wav|99|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_122.wav|92|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_306.wav|84|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_022.wav|78|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_312.wav|21|It was not a cover-up.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_217.wav|46|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_308.wav|18|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_075.wav|31|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_221.wav|57|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_198.wav|49|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_197.wav|107|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_335.wav|2|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_343.wav|1|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_400.wav|76|His primary residence is Scotland.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_090.wav|24|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_358.wav|56|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_023.wav|49|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_255.wav|29|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_163.wav|81|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_152.wav|90|We should be clear about the role of government.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_275.wav|30|That got me out of jail.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_018.wav|3|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_276.wav|96|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_106.wav|85|We are making progress on waiting lists.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_375.wav|106|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_127.wav|40|It is not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_153.wav|40|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_292.wav|90|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_254.wav|23|They may differ on other issues.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_189.wav|70|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_158.wav|103|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_075.wav|85|It is clear that change is required.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_284.wav|38|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_070.wav|24|I am about protecting the state pension.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_200.wav|32|It comes from reflection or thinking.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_206.wav|99|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_078.wav|2|I was too young.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_269.wav|43|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_323.wav|66|We do need to get the message across.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_069.wav|85|We are still going ahead with our plans.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_172.wav|10|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_283.wav|95|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_025.wav|1|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_325.wav|9|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_015.wav|11|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_206.wav|1|That was one very hard game.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_309.wav|27|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_317.wav|51|Neither was involved in violence.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_205.wav|65|I saw people on fire.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_300.wav|58|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_314.wav|27|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_148.wav|46|Is the war over?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_401.wav|34|Five officers were injured.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_044.wav|68|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_057.wav|56|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_398.wav|77|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_343.wav|12|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_143.wav|49|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_235.wav|41|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_243.wav|55|I did let myself down a bit.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_284.wav|25|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_336.wav|18|It's the body that counts.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_364.wav|41|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_312.wav|57|We do the same.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_110.wav|49|Or was it?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_307.wav|63|It was simply no contest.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_169.wav|3|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_333.wav|78|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_216.wav|42|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_280.wav|91|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_036.wav|91|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_339.wav|27|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_274.wav|72|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_372.wav|42|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_392.wav|68|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_111.wav|13|What are they like?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_014.wav|72|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_323.wav|0|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_400.wav|89|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_015.wav|57|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_222.wav|88|What do you do.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_343.wav|103|But he is frustrated at every turn.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_280.wav|37|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_420.wav|49|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_131.wav|4|Planning is a key issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_326.wav|99|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_170.wav|65|No, but my wife is.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_343.wav|54|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_297.wav|94|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_338.wav|35|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_163.wav|11|However, it is not all bad news for women.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_130.wav|99|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_356.wav|49|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_169.wav|14|It is not normal practice.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_159.wav|76|They may differ on other issues.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_048.wav|92|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_039.wav|21|It is up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_410.wav|8|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_097.wav|0|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_327.wav|63|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_251.wav|28|I tend not to look back.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_103.wav|37|The fans would love it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_202.wav|18|Lester was like that.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_276.wav|26|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_050.wav|31|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_166.wav|93|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_302.wav|84|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_394.wav|89|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_276.wav|40|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_079.wav|106|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_335.wav|38|They've not let anyone into the loop.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_022.wav|38|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_128.wav|52|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_439.wav|95|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_158.wav|98|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_230.wav|60|The characters are always the first attraction.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_412.wav|48|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_147.wav|69|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_419.wav|27|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_379.wav|67|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_434.wav|39|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_319.wav|43|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_328.wav|0|This is a source of real concern for the area.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_235.wav|59|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_132.wav|76|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_161.wav|64|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_188.wav|63|We have a long way to go this week.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_298.wav|93|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_423.wav|46|I have not come in to take over.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_201.wav|62|Now there's a thought.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_358.wav|25|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_172.wav|63|Adventure is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_198.wav|46|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_274.wav|64|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_038.wav|80|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_262.wav|65|They made such decisions in London.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_035.wav|104|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_248.wav|6|He is to be commended.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_231.wav|7|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_029.wav|87|The first appeared to be successful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_339.wav|98|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_041.wav|12|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_175.wav|47|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_296.wav|80|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_279.wav|12|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_406.wav|85|Its first awards will just do that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_150.wav|106|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_201.wav|93|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_097.wav|2|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_167.wav|14|There's always the next century.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_031.wav|30|It has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_073.wav|82|Everyone was writing me off.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_249.wav|67|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_382.wav|97|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_093.wav|87|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_164.wav|14|That view has not altered.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_244.wav|33|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_311.wav|0|We will make a statement tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_346.wav|106|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_339.wav|72|That is why this action has been taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_272.wav|11|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_119.wav|78|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_186.wav|27|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_257.wav|44|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_120.wav|45|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_287.wav|53|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_220.wav|14|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_408.wav|6|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_100.wav|86|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_183.wav|93|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_015.wav|26|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_365.wav|75|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_177.wav|67|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_106.wav|29|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_348.wav|98|He is very much respected within the group.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_350.wav|63|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_256.wav|86|They are real.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_327.wav|21|Everyone believes in it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_333.wav|22|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_177.wav|26|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_148.wav|5|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_418.wav|36|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_207.wav|95|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_352.wav|20|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_336.wav|48|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_063.wav|21|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_299.wav|62|The atmosphere is businesslike.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_389.wav|46|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_031.wav|11|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_197.wav|14|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_304.wav|79|I will build a house on the site.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_221.wav|21|Here we have not had one hour.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_094.wav|75|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_315.wav|19|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_184.wav|104|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_223.wav|63|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_120.wav|73|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_318.wav|23|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_248.wav|85|They are you, the fans.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_054.wav|63|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_028.wav|61|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_012.wav|83|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_027.wav|66|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_331.wav|83|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_339.wav|10|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_178.wav|56|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_364.wav|74|It simply doesn't happen.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_426.wav|56|No date has been fixed for his return.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_089.wav|59|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_103.wav|74|He almost admitted as much.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_043.wav|49|All the oil companies are talking together.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_236.wav|39|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_264.wav|66|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_412.wav|8|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_339.wav|50|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_026.wav|91|They changed the world of music.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_334.wav|26|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_033.wav|34|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_022.wav|1|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_387.wav|54|It broke up my marriage.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_159.wav|83|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_010.wav|83|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_310.wav|75|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_168.wav|29|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_332.wav|91|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_141.wav|4|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_133.wav|20|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_136.wav|20|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_374.wav|28|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_114.wav|100|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_101.wav|90|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_026.wav|79|That is where the damage has been done.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_359.wav|52|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_012.wav|75|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_310.wav|68|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_137.wav|94|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_282.wav|24|We are aiming for early March.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_203.wav|34|There is no reason to put me out.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_031.wav|78|They were in good humour, too.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_376.wav|95|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_298.wav|31|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_411.wav|85|It is not that sort of inquiry.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_254.wav|53|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_320.wav|84|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_223.wav|85|They went back to the seventeenth.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_374.wav|104|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_347.wav|8|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_386.wav|16|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_217.wav|102|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_250.wav|17|I would urge the Government to think again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_232.wav|99|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_194.wav|45|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_387.wav|47|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_192.wav|78|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_214.wav|81|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_384.wav|98|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_320.wav|98|Yes, it was uplifting.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_218.wav|71|"It's a question of creating a future awareness."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_228.wav|7|We have an election in eight days.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_251.wav|94|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_089.wav|93|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_082.wav|65|It looks that way.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_247.wav|0|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_131.wav|34|We are in a very strong position.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_228.wav|10|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_142.wav|18|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_359.wav|77|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_145.wav|34|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_160.wav|13|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_212.wav|92|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_172.wav|60|The next game is today.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_374.wav|107|We're not comparing like with like.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_112.wav|93|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_362.wav|33|What's wrong with that?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_125.wav|8|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_336.wav|27|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_392.wav|1|She was my big sister.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_079.wav|76|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_050.wav|75|I haven't been ill at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_494.wav|48|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_007.wav|62|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_304.wav|90|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p245/p245_063.wav|59|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_093.wav|32|It was a family tragedy.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_163.wav|57|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_242.wav|50|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_368.wav|100|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_373.wav|89|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_274.wav|16|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_279.wav|36|We are aiming for early March.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_039.wav|84|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_271.wav|105|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_217.wav|66|I'm a bit annoyed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_241.wav|63|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_073.wav|56|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_200.wav|24|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_020.wav|104|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_407.wav|8|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_014.wav|85|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_027.wav|36|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_012.wav|18|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_169.wav|65|I've no idea how it works.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_185.wav|71|"What has caused the demise of singing?"
DUMMY2/p336/p336_030.wav|98|How could it not?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_224.wav|52|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_026.wav|13|O, Is he conscious?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_148.wav|64|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_022.wav|58|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_324.wav|22|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_171.wav|85|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_406.wav|7|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_175.wav|3|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_014.wav|107|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_094.wav|92|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_278.wav|107|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_006.wav|64|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_133.wav|88|He will be fine.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_239.wav|81|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_252.wav|75|It's important to get it right.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_237.wav|45|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_220.wav|49|They will have to make changes.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_092.wav|104|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_343.wav|36|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_198.wav|71|"But we are not immune to the problem."
DUMMY2/p374/p374_007.wav|11|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_028.wav|40|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_350.wav|40|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_072.wav|12|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_340.wav|87|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_019.wav|67|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_044.wav|86|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_119.wav|73|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_190.wav|13|A crucial moment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_319.wav|99|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_249.wav|49|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_234.wav|20|It's a killer piece.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_247.wav|28|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_411.wav|63|I've had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_109.wav|103|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_105.wav|50|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_158.wav|93|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_224.wav|51|John Lennon is a very large industry.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_209.wav|97|However, what is his calibre?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_070.wav|102|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_319.wav|54|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_384.wav|60|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_027.wav|24|I am pretty careful with money.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_329.wav|39|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_427.wav|7|There was an element of frustration.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_008.wav|68|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_057.wav|35|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_328.wav|103|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_245.wav|89|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_279.wav|71|"The death toll included five children."
DUMMY2/p265/p265_110.wav|73|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_062.wav|56|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_113.wav|32|Structural changes were also required.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_055.wav|7|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_071.wav|29|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_367.wav|83|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_292.wav|72|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_353.wav|27|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_203.wav|1|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_238.wav|76|There is nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_305.wav|39|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_202.wav|64|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_044.wav|3|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_009.wav|69|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_272.wav|48|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_148.wav|38|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_011.wav|44|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_028.wav|53|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_066.wav|89|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_117.wav|24|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_254.wav|64|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_195.wav|84|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_155.wav|6|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_028.wav|91|The law has got to be upheld.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_153.wav|67|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_306.wav|93|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_291.wav|88|We have no knowledge of this.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_154.wav|29|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_244.wav|75|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_352.wav|97|There's no doubt about it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_084.wav|1|That is the crunch.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_019.wav|103|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_170.wav|97|It is no place for a poet.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_306.wav|82|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_408.wav|52|So it looks like a done deal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_328.wav|51|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_040.wav|66|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_384.wav|15|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_058.wav|24|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_154.wav|8|The transaction is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_110.wav|92|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_179.wav|40|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_124.wav|103|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_154.wav|17|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_146.wav|66|Their condition was described as stable.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_169.wav|63|The bank was now involved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_329.wav|4|But that's not the idea behind this article.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_198.wav|77|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_170.wav|93|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_141.wav|62|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_292.wav|78|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_209.wav|36|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_032.wav|45|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_203.wav|73|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_017.wav|107|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_234.wav|104|Who does he think will win?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_044.wav|90|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_131.wav|78|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_060.wav|88|Why has it taken so long?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_050.wav|6|He was very grateful for his health.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_009.wav|31|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_045.wav|56|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_210.wav|98|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_055.wav|29|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_345.wav|47|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_060.wav|8|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_166.wav|39|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_157.wav|56|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_236.wav|14|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_415.wav|20|He was really great.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_364.wav|75|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_233.wav|29|The fight is under way.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_320.wav|105|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_285.wav|74|They were very unfair to him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_128.wav|32|Does the name matter ?)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_105.wav|87|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_166.wav|16|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_085.wav|47|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_350.wav|4|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_186.wav|94|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_259.wav|85|We shall be ready for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_219.wav|55|We tried four banks.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_098.wav|78|It took an option on the process.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_272.wav|58|I have been totally taken aback by this.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_091.wav|40|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_086.wav|54|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_035.wav|75|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_096.wav|57|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_260.wav|70|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_119.wav|47|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_138.wav|105|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_028.wav|44|That is just a load of baloney.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_166.wav|10|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_302.wav|99|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_104.wav|56|Got to win today, though.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_175.wav|22|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_395.wav|94|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_237.wav|7|His third goal was superb.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_095.wav|90|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_374.wav|60|What's the difference?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_111.wav|87|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_374.wav|97|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_302.wav|51|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_304.wav|9|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_401.wav|15|My mother was getting on at me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_060.wav|81|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_139.wav|94|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_184.wav|30|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_397.wav|46|It is not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_163.wav|77|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_247.wav|83|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_144.wav|32|There is no mandate for a regime change.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_109.wav|23|The objective was achieved.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_347.wav|14|So what happens next ?)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_297.wav|39|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_210.wav|84|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_194.wav|36|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_081.wav|36|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_074.wav|87|I am relishing the challenge.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_115.wav|85|We will win this tie.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_056.wav|25|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_284.wav|93|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_324.wav|3|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_078.wav|100|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_125.wav|106|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_115.wav|11|They have just got to believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_010.wav|88|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_154.wav|39|It is the quality of the work that counts.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_139.wav|67|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_277.wav|48|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_221.wav|59|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_070.wav|63|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_233.wav|94|But she was.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_046.wav|20|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_151.wav|47|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_062.wav|0|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_381.wav|10|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_265.wav|94|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_084.wav|52|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_006.wav|21|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_264.wav|71|"We are happy."
DUMMY2/p340/p340_098.wav|74|He did not have to stop and think.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_092.wav|78|It sounds a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_013.wav|7|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p247/p247_329.wav|14|Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_367.wav|43|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_129.wav|23|In fact, they should have scored three times.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_005.wav|79|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_053.wav|11|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_237.wav|17|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_457.wav|65|The truth was rather different.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_031.wav|106|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_157.wav|25|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_258.wav|20|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_259.wav|42|They were assured that it would.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_230.wav|12|This is all part of being opening the door.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_199.wav|69|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_023.wav|11|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_366.wav|53|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_007.wav|40|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_058.wav|94|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_333.wav|70|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_245.wav|8|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_127.wav|2|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_337.wav|82|I'm very happy tonight.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_063.wav|26|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_375.wav|15|Maybe his time has gone.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_254.wav|86|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_334.wav|49|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_309.wav|4|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_024.wav|5|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_195.wav|46|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_368.wav|99|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_167.wav|55|It wasn't a pretty match.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_255.wav|26|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_386.wav|0|We have made no final decisions.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_227.wav|102|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_007.wav|7|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p240/p240_179.wav|93|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_072.wav|71|"The price cuts are really exciting."
DUMMY2/p333/p333_035.wav|64|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_378.wav|54|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_159.wav|93|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_046.wav|87|Something has to give sometime.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_466.wav|95|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_291.wav|91|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_192.wav|58|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_395.wav|33|What is it about this series?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_088.wav|65|They're already booked for next year.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_258.wav|66|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_083.wav|20|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_419.wav|14|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_079.wav|34|The punishment was swift.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_111.wav|30|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_135.wav|4|Yet what is supposed to be said?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_365.wav|15|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_419.wav|36|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_336.wav|107|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_160.wav|89|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_267.wav|14|There will be widespread support on all sides.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_166.wav|43|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_353.wav|68|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_355.wav|43|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_086.wav|91|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_069.wav|63|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_342.wav|4|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_214.wav|21|He said he would appeal the sentences.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_141.wav|22|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_119.wav|75|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_435.wav|36|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_375.wav|26|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_205.wav|17|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_239.wav|38|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_376.wav|78|You have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_285.wav|73|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_364.wav|58|The surprise is its product is so poor.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_157.wav|105|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_040.wav|44|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_090.wav|98|We have to get this sorted out.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_035.wav|97|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_081.wav|41|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_254.wav|75|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_333.wav|92|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_248.wav|57|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_174.wav|4|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_390.wav|1|The line-up is a tasty one.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_221.wav|49|The next one comes up.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_232.wav|84|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_229.wav|33|It was the train coming.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_310.wav|85|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_400.wav|105|I am the Son of Sam.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_293.wav|67|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_356.wav|31|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_425.wav|75|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_014.wav|22|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_137.wav|106|He had missed a penalty against the English.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_287.wav|82|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_191.wav|106|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_259.wav|75|It was quite a new prescription.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_115.wav|88|We don't know what is happening to them.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_212.wav|93|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_064.wav|47|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_294.wav|89|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_275.wav|67|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_089.wav|87|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_120.wav|21|I cannot believe this decision.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_349.wav|65|The book is closed.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_245.wav|103|We went on to become very successful.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_033.wav|45|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_181.wav|62|He was a legend.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_034.wav|72|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_350.wav|42|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_173.wav|53|If successful, several records will be made.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_168.wav|50|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_347.wav|44|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_275.wav|107|That got me out of jail.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_137.wav|40|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_302.wav|88|The proposals have been taken out of context.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_151.wav|44|It is always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_230.wav|16|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_019.wav|53|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_095.wav|85|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_114.wav|60|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_209.wav|73|But she was.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_169.wav|105|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_408.wav|17|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_322.wav|92|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_331.wav|20|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_240.wav|24|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_276.wav|100|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_417.wav|17|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_301.wav|5|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_132.wav|36|He wants to win a major.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_270.wav|9|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_109.wav|60|It is looking very special.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_364.wav|86|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_150.wav|97|We never got off the bus.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_418.wav|78|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_147.wav|38|It was so physical.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_381.wav|53|This is not a small amount of money.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_149.wav|89|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_226.wav|82|I believe in the Union.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_102.wav|85|It will take several days.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_183.wav|44|Two men have been charged with his murder.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_172.wav|94|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_173.wav|14|We will turn the corner.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_296.wav|45|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_096.wav|60|Buildings are about people.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_171.wav|38|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_396.wav|82|There is still a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_202.wav|97|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_284.wav|95|You can never tell with the manager.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_334.wav|24|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_286.wav|47|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_430.wav|14|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_351.wav|78|He is a great prospect.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_274.wav|12|It does not move, which is amazing.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_060.wav|39|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_090.wav|58|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_387.wav|25|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_132.wav|44|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_043.wav|94|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_157.wav|46|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_453.wav|75|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_297.wav|28|There's a strong involvement.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_115.wav|53|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_374.wav|106|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_280.wav|31|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_394.wav|79|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_173.wav|45|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_045.wav|6|In my experience, he does not do that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_125.wav|18|The Scots are great.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_041.wav|15|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_304.wav|13|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_064.wav|70|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_378.wav|25|It doesn't always work that way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_270.wav|60|He is having a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_251.wav|74|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_298.wav|64|Raised the way you want it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_339.wav|95|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_354.wav|82|I've never felt affection for Emu.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_265.wav|90|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_255.wav|93|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_224.wav|88|This one would have been.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_012.wav|81|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_047.wav|63|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_134.wav|56|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_117.wav|51|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_055.wav|68|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_108.wav|86|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_041.wav|63|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_054.wav|87|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_036.wav|59|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_023.wav|12|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_040.wav|18|What will happen to them today?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_434.wav|56|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_374.wav|94|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_357.wav|13|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_255.wav|6|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_413.wav|76|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_058.wav|4|I just went a bit too far.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_233.wav|79|But it is being pursued.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_136.wav|55|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_234.wav|47|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_121.wav|71|"So the European elections are extremely important."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_416.wav|98|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_410.wav|97|What's wrong with that?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_308.wav|85|We have got to attack.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_177.wav|51|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_388.wav|104|But what is?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_333.wav|107|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_364.wav|10|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_343.wav|14|Are they free ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_410.wav|76|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_258.wav|91|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_041.wav|79|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_139.wav|105|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_048.wav|1|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_424.wav|24|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_003.wav|89|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_108.wav|99|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_165.wav|67|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_229.wav|85|I waited and waited.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_209.wav|6|This is really good news for us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_221.wav|31|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_173.wav|99|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_399.wav|10|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_302.wav|98|I seem to keep this for the majors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_363.wav|32|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_317.wav|65|Other teams moved up too.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_265.wav|104|This will have no effect on the championship.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_279.wav|86|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_112.wav|7|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_283.wav|48|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_086.wav|28|I can't believe it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_397.wav|2|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_254.wav|65|For that reason cover should not be given.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_377.wav|89|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_321.wav|12|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_383.wav|56|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_287.wav|28|We have to focus on what is important.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_006.wav|49|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_296.wav|97|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_200.wav|19|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_290.wav|73|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_244.wav|21|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_216.wav|29|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_260.wav|65|We had a grand view.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_247.wav|27|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_046.wav|75|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_368.wav|40|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_226.wav|94|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_117.wav|95|It's for that reason he should resign.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_202.wav|30|I've never been limited on drugs.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_123.wav|107|Do not go into government buildings.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_036.wav|54|People ask about the concept of a team.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_183.wav|98|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_226.wav|70|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_087.wav|81|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_293.wav|94|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_070.wav|37|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_300.wav|56|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_097.wav|93|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_013.wav|90|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_136.wav|105|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_279.wav|96|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_391.wav|72|I don't care to recall it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_338.wav|51|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_354.wav|94|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_367.wav|36|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_335.wav|26|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_194.wav|10|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_172.wav|89|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_099.wav|87|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_132.wav|41|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_027.wav|20|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_096.wav|59|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_187.wav|60|It was a disaster of a race.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_388.wav|92|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_016.wav|57|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_058.wav|30|We must improve our relations with the government.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_038.wav|33|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_176.wav|40|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_323.wav|60|He should be worried about me.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_118.wav|7|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_374.wav|27|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_381.wav|56|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_142.wav|49|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_020.wav|102|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_230.wav|66|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_169.wav|49|Where is the structure?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_235.wav|5|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_244.wav|34|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_221.wav|16|But she was.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_382.wav|34|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_050.wav|99|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_422.wav|92|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_249.wav|66|It doesn't make sense.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_171.wav|17|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_351.wav|26|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_404.wav|68|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_369.wav|105|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_306.wav|78|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_064.wav|10|But it has been an amazing experience.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_101.wav|23|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_087.wav|89|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_100.wav|28|It was set in a cafe.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_073.wav|101|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_059.wav|56|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_359.wav|23|The initial reaction was disbelief.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_221.wav|7|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_133.wav|16|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_209.wav|2|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_142.wav|71|"Is that Titanic?"
DUMMY2/p277/p277_344.wav|89|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_134.wav|91|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_126.wav|75|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_011.wav|70|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_140.wav|90|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_161.wav|62|I think it's a sensible change.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_374.wav|9|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_221.wav|35|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_133.wav|28|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_331.wav|99|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_086.wav|82|He insisted that his staff were too.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_203.wav|102|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_030.wav|23|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_416.wav|7|We have very limited capacity.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_222.wav|24|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_439.wav|50|The British government does not want to know.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_256.wav|104|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_058.wav|76|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_293.wav|54|It really is a gift to the world.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_237.wav|37|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_140.wav|9|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_213.wav|91|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_030.wav|71|"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_237.wav|50|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_068.wav|40|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_264.wav|103|It was also put on the Internet.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_094.wav|90|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_198.wav|95|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_073.wav|66|They had had time for little else.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_235.wav|85|We are aware of the problem.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_300.wav|81|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_377.wav|15|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_155.wav|39|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_367.wav|49|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_340.wav|74|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_155.wav|66|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_396.wav|48|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_368.wav|26|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_236.wav|99|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_285.wav|18|But do not rely on it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_166.wav|24|The whole industry is a shambles.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_022.wav|49|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_256.wav|5|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_349.wav|85|We have to open up.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_088.wav|74|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_041.wav|107|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_084.wav|106|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_251.wav|69|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_032.wav|79|But we need to keep it there.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_008.wav|69|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_048.wav|106|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_177.wav|59|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_114.wav|83|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_319.wav|70|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_336.wav|95|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_493.wav|75|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_223.wav|43|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_004.wav|84|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_373.wav|55|This is far too high.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_001.wav|59|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_101.wav|28|It certainly gives you hope.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_252.wav|41|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_218.wav|83|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_381.wav|47|I know I'm in a very special position.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_097.wav|15|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_266.wav|78|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_038.wav|24|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_207.wav|28|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_121.wav|7|That admission is not surprising.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_243.wav|38|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_012.wav|92|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_167.wav|80|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_291.wav|63|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_008.wav|92|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_276.wav|105|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_150.wav|103|And really, the songs are the key thing.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_208.wav|107|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_351.wav|7|Scotland has shown the way.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_164.wav|87|And so the cycle continues.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_294.wav|70|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_331.wav|2|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_301.wav|69|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_238.wav|101|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_069.wav|5|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_201.wav|37|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_106.wav|71|"The fire was above the hole."
DUMMY2/p256/p256_039.wav|90|It's a real threat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_286.wav|15|He will not be coming back.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_090.wav|107|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_070.wav|35|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_274.wav|42|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_341.wav|100|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_313.wav|87|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_060.wav|43|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_239.wav|26|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_241.wav|51|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_166.wav|6|My father and mother are.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_224.wav|45|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_409.wav|62|I put pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_041.wav|11|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_342.wav|64|So, how will it be received in the US?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_109.wav|45|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_362.wav|82|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_378.wav|51|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_102.wav|56|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_177.wav|103|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_363.wav|18|There are many questions to be answered.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_329.wav|38|I will be standing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_153.wav|96|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_351.wav|64|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_169.wav|75|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_374.wav|89|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_016.wav|54|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_439.wav|48|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_330.wav|28|She looked very, very poor.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_229.wav|67|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_386.wav|38|This fight is not going to go away.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_356.wav|67|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_144.wav|14|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_380.wav|79|That was a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_324.wav|45|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_301.wav|70|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_268.wav|18|Should he resign?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_159.wav|40|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_114.wav|57|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_271.wav|58|We do things in an appropriate way.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_194.wav|80|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_410.wav|105|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_170.wav|8|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_354.wav|59|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_262.wav|77|They are very keen to work with us.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_063.wav|78|He said it was for sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_385.wav|19|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_169.wav|95|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_143.wav|27|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_154.wav|1|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_160.wav|6|He said it was his greatest work.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_349.wav|52|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_300.wav|31|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_363.wav|64|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_227.wav|103|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_015.wav|2|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_324.wav|98|I don't want to do too much.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_242.wav|33|He was embarrassed about what he did.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_098.wav|50|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_084.wav|31|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_213.wav|27|You have a plan?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_061.wav|96|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_131.wav|101|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_369.wav|62|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_024.wav|18|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_268.wav|52|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_130.wav|95|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_329.wav|26|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_055.wav|12|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_208.wav|95|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_129.wav|52|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_067.wav|6|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_275.wav|9|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_105.wav|61|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_031.wav|70|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_198.wav|9|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_008.wav|12|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_226.wav|34|They loved it and it showed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_397.wav|15|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_040.wav|82|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_334.wav|103|That is not the way we should operate.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_236.wav|102|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_183.wav|33|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_216.wav|40|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_147.wav|47|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_421.wav|42|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_042.wav|10|Well, the climate has changed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_099.wav|41|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_359.wav|62|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_363.wav|24|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_315.wav|92|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_122.wav|7|In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_211.wav|6|A senior party insider said.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_112.wav|4|He has one son and one daughter.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_259.wav|15|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_384.wav|45|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_341.wav|40|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_081.wav|33|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_043.wav|23|We can be proud of our achievements.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_168.wav|20|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_236.wav|90|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_323.wav|70|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_147.wav|88|I would say so.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_244.wav|65|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_450.wav|39|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_381.wav|67|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_031.wav|67|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_219.wav|63|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_161.wav|60|I told them they shouldn't say that.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_003.wav|6|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_378.wav|21|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_381.wav|14|The major championships will always have a special place.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_323.wav|12|I didn't know what he was capable of.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_391.wav|24|The team hadn't been picked.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_055.wav|65|How are you, sir?)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_195.wav|32|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_190.wav|83|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_075.wav|6|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_065.wav|48|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_282.wav|34|It all changes for her.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_167.wav|68|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_283.wav|4|My office is down there.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_219.wav|20|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_424.wav|105|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_300.wav|33|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_082.wav|16|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_199.wav|102|I like footballers who play well.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_182.wav|102|She is living proof of their expertise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_286.wav|89|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_210.wav|42|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_198.wav|65|Does it matter?)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_117.wav|38|He told the conference.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_175.wav|41|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_268.wav|101|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_262.wav|17|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_338.wav|95|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_347.wav|15|Maybe they will show it next year.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_174.wav|2|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_341.wav|21|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_377.wav|75|I understand the frustration of the fans.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_034.wav|107|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_257.wav|20|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_276.wav|88|It goes in cycles.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_376.wav|47|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_363.wav|93|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_136.wav|43|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_054.wav|7|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_251.wav|64|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_014.wav|41|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_139.wav|3|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_210.wav|57|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_375.wav|50|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_140.wav|94|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_130.wav|96|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_130.wav|84|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_315.wav|73|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_408.wav|7|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_312.wav|48|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_235.wav|107|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_252.wav|19|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_122.wav|79|It was on my mind a little bit.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_183.wav|52|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_232.wav|21|She has not returned to work.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_258.wav|87|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_037.wav|84|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_314.wav|12|It was just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_393.wav|53|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_048.wav|89|We will push.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_271.wav|27|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_019.wav|57|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_069.wav|34|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_299.wav|58|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_134.wav|28|That means no more taxation by stealth.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_106.wav|19|However, he added there were signs of progress.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_223.wav|17|But he's not afraid to take risks.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_225.wav|7|I won't make an official complaint.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_136.wav|97|These services may also have to be cut.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_424.wav|103|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_167.wav|95|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_322.wav|27|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_348.wav|100|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_270.wav|54|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_186.wav|87|That was just one night.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_487.wav|48|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_351.wav|32|He declined to comment on possible disposals.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_089.wav|77|We intend to change the model.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_337.wav|16|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_267.wav|49|We will build upon the basic state pension.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_163.wav|20|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_291.wav|59|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_266.wav|102|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_183.wav|94|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_418.wav|107|Or so she thought.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_364.wav|36|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_337.wav|59|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_149.wav|84|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_191.wav|105|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_260.wav|14|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_017.wav|101|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_170.wav|38|We have taken steps to rectify it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_171.wav|76|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_230.wav|26|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_147.wav|48|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_121.wav|69|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_083.wav|70|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_183.wav|7|It is vital to clarify their role.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_389.wav|50|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_104.wav|102|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_243.wav|8|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_206.wav|28|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_290.wav|66|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_246.wav|31|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_229.wav|26|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_188.wav|14|Talks are at an advanced stage.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_006.wav|84|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_306.wav|60|What does this mean?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_307.wav|21|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_055.wav|86|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_371.wav|65|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_003.wav|12|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_342.wav|74|They should have listened to me.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_215.wav|55|Fine, said the press officer.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_121.wav|24|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_170.wav|106|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_149.wav|31|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_237.wav|80|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_315.wav|64|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_303.wav|38|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_183.wav|100|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_423.wav|72|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_317.wav|28|Anyone can take a photo.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_291.wav|49|Famously, though, there was a catch.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_472.wav|75|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_081.wav|99|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_085.wav|63|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_383.wav|95|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_120.wav|56|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_068.wav|60|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_055.wav|77|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_296.wav|0|He wants to talk a lot.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_110.wav|9|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_247.wav|86|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_217.wav|69|But she was.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_256.wav|32|What form did that take ?)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_387.wav|46|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_135.wav|31|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_085.wav|22|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_004.wav|50|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_064.wav|46|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_034.wav|51|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_387.wav|52|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_282.wav|46|There are no plans to change this.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_322.wav|82|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_309.wav|107|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_286.wav|71|"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained."
DUMMY2/p316/p316_359.wav|85|I'd like to report a murder.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_202.wav|25|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_062.wav|79|It is not for me to say.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_351.wav|104|That was the type of man he was.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_137.wav|11|Now, that would impress the kids.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_402.wav|96|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_052.wav|45|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_241.wav|68|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_377.wav|42|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_087.wav|102|We do need a new one.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_152.wav|66|Such a city does not exist.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_149.wav|13|You're not going to forget something like that.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_195.wav|0|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_281.wav|91|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_085.wav|50|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_036.wav|42|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_133.wav|37|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_217.wav|98|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_101.wav|93|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_235.wav|91|Correction, knowing him, he might.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_359.wav|46|Which he can do.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_497.wav|48|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_081.wav|95|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_329.wav|72|The search has been called off.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_209.wav|89|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_401.wav|26|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_319.wav|91|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_230.wav|74|He may have a long wait.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_317.wav|0|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_064.wav|34|Then they killed another three.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_205.wav|16|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_305.wav|37|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_058.wav|3|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_079.wav|90|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_407.wav|60|And he's not alone.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_147.wav|36|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_253.wav|23|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_046.wav|42|Except for this, it was offside.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_356.wav|87|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_021.wav|18|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_244.wav|24|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_353.wav|51|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_438.wav|37|We discovered that for ourselves.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_372.wav|58|But then, that really is the point.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_411.wav|16|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_252.wav|21|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_166.wav|27|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_334.wav|65|I saw one man vote five times.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_306.wav|95|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_019.wav|86|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_233.wav|73|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_203.wav|84|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_084.wav|30|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_191.wav|8|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_016.wav|90|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_084.wav|49|They're completely different from each other.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_157.wav|16|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_243.wav|9|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_287.wav|13|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_177.wav|17|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_127.wav|105|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_445.wav|36|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_279.wav|61|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_094.wav|94|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_232.wav|32|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_216.wav|1|We are not far from a deal.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_343.wav|0|A report is expected next month.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_070.wav|80|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_238.wav|70|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_169.wav|38|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_005.wav|103|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_257.wav|60|Human beings are always the same.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_068.wav|62|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_419.wav|89|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_063.wav|85|He said it was for sale.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_245.wav|16|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_164.wav|59|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_374.wav|58|I didn't do too badly myself.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_145.wav|30|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_397.wav|1|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_419.wav|46|They wanted to show what they could do.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_245.wav|102|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_281.wav|80|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_083.wav|43|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_266.wav|70|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_356.wav|43|She is free.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_321.wav|25|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_110.wav|81|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_062.wav|69|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_204.wav|83|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_372.wav|2|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_256.wav|103|And how he kept his word.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_113.wav|69|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_143.wav|19|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_136.wav|16|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_075.wav|97|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_301.wav|83|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_243.wav|93|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_218.wav|62|I played well in my time there.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_022.wav|7|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY2/p230/p230_258.wav|35|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_337.wav|63|Survival is not an option.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_178.wav|59|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_058.wav|50|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_116.wav|72|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_200.wav|58|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_049.wav|38|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_101.wav|34|Club rugby refuses to die.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_360.wav|20|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_358.wav|50|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_323.wav|49|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_362.wav|91|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_362.wav|23|I now know that from memory.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_173.wav|8|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_211.wav|57|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_192.wav|13|Next time round, it will be different.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_201.wav|46|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_107.wav|16|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_290.wav|101|Scotch beef is badly missed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_286.wav|92|I'm not sure.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_319.wav|85|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_357.wav|103|You don't do the same thing with men.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_095.wav|21|And so it goes on.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_110.wav|54|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_459.wav|50|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_065.wav|97|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_006.wav|104|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_134.wav|67|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_195.wav|39|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_247.wav|11|This was not an easy meeting for me.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_144.wav|3|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_383.wav|77|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_118.wav|91|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_096.wav|99|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_382.wav|10|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_382.wav|91|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_073.wav|45|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_058.wav|32|We will pay their bills.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_383.wav|79|Conditions were less than ideal.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_073.wav|105|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_032.wav|43|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_318.wav|53|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_264.wav|23|We have got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_200.wav|37|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_305.wav|58|There is nothing like a fresh start.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_111.wav|53|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_113.wav|83|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_042.wav|42|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_271.wav|33|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_234.wav|93|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_314.wav|66|No-one thought about this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_087.wav|39|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_197.wav|30|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_255.wav|65|He felt too close to head office.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_258.wav|93|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_069.wav|44|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_330.wav|91|It will also take evidence from consumers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_090.wav|91|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_220.wav|47|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_025.wav|24|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_135.wav|12|However, details have yet to be worked out.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_126.wav|63|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_079.wav|46|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_235.wav|47|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_161.wav|83|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_322.wav|65|Our relationship has been very good.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_406.wav|75|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_335.wav|56|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_378.wav|106|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_426.wav|24|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_058.wav|13|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_320.wav|93|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_004.wav|51|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_347.wav|31|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_295.wav|26|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_252.wav|91|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_202.wav|32|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_388.wav|52|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_131.wav|64|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_051.wav|73|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_376.wav|77|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_322.wav|4|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_266.wav|77|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_361.wav|106|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_353.wav|33|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_411.wav|20|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_218.wav|11|That is just not true.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_265.wav|72|He has changed the country itself.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_120.wav|2|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_104.wav|2|It was an interesting thing to do.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_143.wav|44|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_408.wav|26|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_103.wav|45|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_338.wav|43|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_362.wav|19|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_295.wav|36|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_346.wav|86|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_016.wav|15|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_267.wav|76|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_247.wav|9|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_190.wav|6|It was far more important than that.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_102.wav|23|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_069.wav|49|It is a family day out.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_228.wav|28|No-one should see that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_401.wav|106|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_221.wav|58|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_335.wav|77|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_007.wav|19|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_305.wav|7|We shall rely on human beings.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_063.wav|1|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_239.wav|104|Do it for us now.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_306.wav|80|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_252.wav|83|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_331.wav|73|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_068.wav|3|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_444.wav|7|It means an enormous amount.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_141.wav|10|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_058.wav|58|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_188.wav|4|But we still don't know.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_024.wav|79|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_220.wav|56|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_370.wav|23|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_249.wav|41|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_267.wav|10|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_398.wav|47|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_018.wav|85|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_039.wav|11|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_347.wav|73|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_129.wav|43|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_053.wav|98|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_006.wav|41|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_028.wav|89|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_164.wav|52|Surely it can't run for two years.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_247.wav|17|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_131.wav|103|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_058.wav|101|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_223.wav|103|I'm really happy with the way it went.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_229.wav|10|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_127.wav|7|But it is different in different regions.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_369.wav|75|We are a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_117.wav|73|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_261.wav|65|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_382.wav|102|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_381.wav|85|Is that such a bad thing?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_405.wav|38|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_053.wav|103|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_211.wav|68|Many, many people don't know who he is.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_072.wav|52|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_226.wav|17|However, it very nearly went wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_187.wav|33|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_215.wav|81|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_464.wav|95|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_026.wav|80|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_004.wav|0|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_368.wav|43|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_198.wav|68|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_287.wav|79|His remarks were disgraceful.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_326.wav|104|Which is where the manager comes in.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_262.wav|21|He knows the course.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_026.wav|2|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_073.wav|97|This is not the most crucial issue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_413.wav|33|I am not sure.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_210.wav|94|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_116.wav|97|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_253.wav|92|In my experience, he does not do that.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_179.wav|68|One person was believed to have been hit.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_167.wav|47|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_138.wav|50|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_143.wav|71|"I was awful."
DUMMY2/p256/p256_092.wav|90|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_002.wav|104|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_292.wav|16|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_224.wav|15|You are not in any kind of trouble.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_401.wav|58|We only lost the third goal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_288.wav|55|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_226.wav|107|It is a form of physical exercise.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_113.wav|29|However, we have to be cautious.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_393.wav|77|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_208.wav|54|I believe in the Church.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_317.wav|41|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_279.wav|104|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_226.wav|5|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_037.wav|94|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_009.wav|8|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_163.wav|103|Trading Places was too obvious.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_124.wav|6|I welcome this Bill.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_239.wav|28|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_176.wav|23|It has made me feel good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_130.wav|41|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_330.wav|46|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_238.wav|53|The children were later able to leave by bus.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_066.wav|8|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_220.wav|67|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_354.wav|48|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_396.wav|62|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_208.wav|51|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_319.wav|73|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_293.wav|39|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_240.wav|92|I am very sorry to hear about this.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_279.wav|17|Today's ruling confirms that.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_093.wav|16|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_318.wav|54|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_100.wav|98|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_157.wav|39|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_015.wav|81|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_066.wav|84|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_372.wav|34|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_087.wav|49|Correction, knowing him, he might.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_084.wav|46|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_060.wav|25|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_348.wav|27|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_159.wav|47|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_132.wav|93|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_224.wav|106|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_171.wav|66|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_333.wav|43|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_394.wav|69|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_113.wav|61|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_382.wav|74|We were all afraid.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_254.wav|14|I have received no explanation.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_321.wav|103|It is high time to act.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_335.wav|6|I've never regretted coming here.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_261.wav|14|Persuaded to change his mind.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_041.wav|5|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_091.wav|60|I've always been very taken by the drink.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_105.wav|31|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_123.wav|81|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_156.wav|52|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_224.wav|61|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_361.wav|39|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_225.wav|84|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_250.wav|79|Nothing was meant by it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_009.wav|22|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_361.wav|18|It could have been a ceilidh.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_254.wav|21|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_302.wav|107|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_250.wav|92|She was close to suicide at one stage.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_327.wav|43|We do the same.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_369.wav|16|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_194.wav|66|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_231.wav|19|It was a stunning strike.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_164.wav|78|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_123.wav|35|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_248.wav|99|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_273.wav|70|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_330.wav|107|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_354.wav|98|No decisions have been made in this respect.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_020.wav|22|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_383.wav|60|Their families are gone.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_029.wav|47|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_214.wav|31|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_246.wav|67|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_044.wav|23|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_157.wav|88|He deserved that much.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_034.wav|4|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_163.wav|83|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_395.wav|14|He took over our lives.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_224.wav|85|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_272.wav|79|So what is the secret of the success?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_174.wav|106|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_378.wav|7|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_243.wav|67|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_279.wav|56|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_054.wav|24|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_053.wav|85|That is not the case this time.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_176.wav|41|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_033.wav|53|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_317.wav|80|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_350.wav|55|I saw one man vote five times.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_379.wav|23|My husband was fighting for his life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_294.wav|105|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_032.wav|11|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_090.wav|65|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_395.wav|66|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_011.wav|39|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_180.wav|25|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_159.wav|38|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_162.wav|68|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_158.wav|78|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_284.wav|2|It was good.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_273.wav|88|It's great fun to get to act.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_170.wav|10|On my day I can beat anyone.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_052.wav|80|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_211.wav|21|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_168.wav|21|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_189.wav|24|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_092.wav|36|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_131.wav|40|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_251.wav|45|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_214.wav|1|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_231.wav|32|A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_020.wav|85|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_017.wav|22|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_236.wav|79|We didn't and it cost us the game.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_145.wav|54|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_135.wav|71|"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_136.wav|89|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_034.wav|87|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_349.wav|96|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_418.wav|14|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_224.wav|11|Does a lot of drawing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_129.wav|104|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_135.wav|89|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_307.wav|12|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_142.wav|21|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_104.wav|51|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_365.wav|66|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_204.wav|25|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_213.wav|19|The squad will be the same for France.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_192.wav|84|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_104.wav|80|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_153.wav|86|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_371.wav|56|The major championships will always have a special place.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_175.wav|79|I've won the British.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_214.wav|9|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_038.wav|86|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_154.wav|62|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_163.wav|91|This is a United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_137.wav|83|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_005.wav|32|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p275/p275_170.wav|40|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_143.wav|101|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_095.wav|79|If it's going in, it goes in.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_292.wav|41|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_352.wav|54|We will see how he is.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_029.wav|94|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_142.wav|60|Or so it seemed.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_149.wav|6|It would have been a very explosive issue.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_238.wav|86|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_303.wav|50|I was just so determined.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_383.wav|16|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_449.wav|14|He deserves a second chance.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_147.wav|9|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_031.wav|97|Is the war over?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_223.wav|24|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_224.wav|81|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_042.wav|93|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_475.wav|7|There was no trouble at all.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_388.wav|79|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_206.wav|88|It is suitable and sensible.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_154.wav|49|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_312.wav|43|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_347.wav|59|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_075.wav|76|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_087.wav|105|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_197.wav|99|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_007.wav|41|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_158.wav|89|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_434.wav|48|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_306.wav|9|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_170.wav|41|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_047.wav|69|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_257.wav|82|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_330.wav|73|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_058.wav|34|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_020.wav|2|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_159.wav|41|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_040.wav|73|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_097.wav|19|But Allen is deadly serious.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_284.wav|44|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_067.wav|79|Nobody else is at risk.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_111.wav|55|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_016.wav|86|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_274.wav|54|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_408.wav|39|It was an amazing afternoon.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_076.wav|73|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_114.wav|24|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_384.wav|78|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_330.wav|24|Job losses were also announced.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_335.wav|54|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_106.wav|51|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_353.wav|78|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_027.wav|64|But who shot the president?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_278.wav|3|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_120.wav|4|There were no new cases yesterday.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_074.wav|21|We are still suffering from that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_400.wav|35|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_281.wav|54|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_335.wav|7|So what happens next ?)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_117.wav|104|And she got it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_094.wav|15|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_103.wav|22|I am very sorry to be here.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_366.wav|91|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_034.wav|43|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_066.wav|15|In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_171.wav|51|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_072.wav|91|Michael is putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_271.wav|7|He said the right things.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_300.wav|40|It could work.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_319.wav|24|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_072.wav|82|Among them is his beloved teacher.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_361.wav|87|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_404.wav|100|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_266.wav|89|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_357.wav|38|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_335.wav|59|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_375.wav|54|We're all in a state of shock.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_007.wav|46|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_383.wav|84|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_315.wav|52|If you believe in the blue and white.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_144.wav|31|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_144.wav|20|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_154.wav|33|If you can work, you should work.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_135.wav|86|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_366.wav|4|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_253.wav|50|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_034.wav|69|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_220.wav|37|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_153.wav|94|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_362.wav|62|We are in a learning curve.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_356.wav|35|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_208.wav|40|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_280.wav|11|I am also delighted for all the players.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_067.wav|23|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_142.wav|69|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_200.wav|11|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_417.wav|63|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_229.wav|5|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_117.wav|27|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_145.wav|94|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_291.wav|72|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_027.wav|72|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_040.wav|6|I think we're a long way forward.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_229.wav|41|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_329.wav|77|The show is at an end.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_352.wav|98|But it was fun.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_370.wav|66|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_358.wav|31|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_063.wav|103|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_346.wav|64|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_422.wav|95|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_378.wav|22|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_020.wav|99|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_369.wav|79|This is a major step forward.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_220.wav|94|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_260.wav|63|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_204.wav|18|That's a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_335.wav|34|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_364.wav|55|Still, I am delighted.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_114.wav|46|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_248.wav|8|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_093.wav|50|We must stop it with the golf ball.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_380.wav|53|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_079.wav|102|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_031.wav|7|Everyone can have their opinion.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_084.wav|9|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_048.wav|62|The group will report back in the summer.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_390.wav|60|In football it is not always the case.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_277.wav|104|From there, it was a success story.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_137.wav|7|It was started almost by accident.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_075.wav|27|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_226.wav|103|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_305.wav|43|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_336.wav|79|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_106.wav|26|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_365.wav|43|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_173.wav|12|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_317.wav|76|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_305.wav|99|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_242.wav|88|We were completely outplayed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_412.wav|1|What is next?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_071.wav|64|Every game against New Zealand is.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_172.wav|45|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_238.wav|3|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_100.wav|29|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_232.wav|67|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_043.wav|104|We're playing away from home and that's it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_028.wav|84|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_009.wav|51|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_301.wav|96|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_118.wav|40|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_142.wav|65|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_325.wav|86|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_308.wav|63|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_439.wav|65|Colin Cameron was excellent.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_401.wav|20|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_224.wav|9|It's just a place to open it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_030.wav|37|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_057.wav|67|She's a spy !
DUMMY2/p308/p308_114.wav|107|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_407.wav|52|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_091.wav|102|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_062.wav|87|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_361.wav|78|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_098.wav|98|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_287.wav|46|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_127.wav|16|The people will come.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_422.wav|4|It's something we want to make work.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_341.wav|84|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_095.wav|82|He was at it again yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_051.wav|95|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_289.wav|49|On occasions he succeeded.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_197.wav|54|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_213.wav|11|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_333.wav|4|This time, however, may have been different.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_049.wav|21|I have no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_326.wav|15|CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_005.wav|25|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_255.wav|84|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_205.wav|94|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_268.wav|47|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_233.wav|28|You write a play.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_150.wav|64|The Scots are great.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_294.wav|80|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_360.wav|57|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_223.wav|86|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_208.wav|44|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_344.wav|79|You've got to hand it to them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_025.wav|53|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_172.wav|93|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_241.wav|92|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_199.wav|48|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_281.wav|82|It could be a danger.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_183.wav|45|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_073.wav|75|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_069.wav|41|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_064.wav|2|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_063.wav|66|He added, It's not a racial problem.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_143.wav|28|It's not hard to get involved.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_214.wav|37|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_470.wav|50|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_270.wav|70|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_028.wav|63|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_338.wav|106|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_114.wav|58|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_457.wav|39|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_202.wav|107|I've never been limited on drugs.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_496.wav|48|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_303.wav|86|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_284.wav|5|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_226.wav|29|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_017.wav|67|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_081.wav|89|It was magic.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_091.wav|54|This is not a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_013.wav|40|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_133.wav|33|That was my mistake.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_042.wav|19|That, though, was just the start of it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_433.wav|50|It is based on a true story.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_134.wav|94|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_201.wav|16|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_201.wav|79|This is clearly not abuse.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_323.wav|5|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_054.wav|3|We are working on it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_231.wav|72|It might not survive the process.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_108.wav|35|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_050.wav|73|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_167.wav|102|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_265.wav|43|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_369.wav|93|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_344.wav|55|It was the September weekend after all.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_201.wav|6|It was quite distressing for the crew.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_230.wav|53|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_242.wav|55|When I was training.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_133.wav|60|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_155.wav|8|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_150.wav|89|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_248.wav|95|There's a chance they might come down.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_053.wav|29|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_344.wav|26|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_310.wav|79|I think it's a good sign.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_425.wav|56|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_079.wav|99|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_185.wav|103|They responded with victories.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_325.wav|106|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_380.wav|45|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_334.wav|98|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_059.wav|18|It gives us something to work on.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_123.wav|70|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_257.wav|14|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_426.wav|48|It certainly feels that way.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_313.wav|58|He was released in March this year.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_084.wav|72|Nor should there have been.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_362.wav|39|That's as it should be.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_305.wav|15|He did it all for us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_051.wav|58|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_291.wav|65|We must move on.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_036.wav|47|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_285.wav|17|I have learned a lot from him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_234.wav|41|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_019.wav|43|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_246.wav|96|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_210.wav|72|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_081.wav|62|We didn't take our chances.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_283.wav|33|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_281.wav|83|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_412.wav|18|I don't know how she does it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_461.wav|39|The rest of the business is very robust.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_212.wav|85|There was no respite.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_294.wav|97|It got no better.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_272.wav|70|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_025.wav|67|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_017.wav|83|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_237.wav|44|But one shouldn't go by that.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_253.wav|14|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_131.wav|70|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_299.wav|95|The next month is very important.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_026.wav|56|It was as if I had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_370.wav|89|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_122.wav|12|I will speak to Michael about this.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_020.wav|28|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_312.wav|93|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_390.wav|98|But this is even worse.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_204.wav|49|She was an only child.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_243.wav|47|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_369.wav|69|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_407.wav|7|We will win the argument.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_024.wav|107|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_397.wav|63|It gets into the culture.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_217.wav|90|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_152.wav|52|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_006.wav|93|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_391.wav|55|I've kept him in touch with everything.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_226.wav|83|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_240.wav|74|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_415.wav|103|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_387.wav|67|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_280.wav|15|It has been a major success.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_005.wav|24|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_369.wav|106|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_399.wav|6|There is a lack of logic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_141.wav|85|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_183.wav|39|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_223.wav|105|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_287.wav|5|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_360.wav|13|Does it, Noel?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_226.wav|20|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_312.wav|61|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_044.wav|56|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_376.wav|100|He took a draw on his cigarette.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_247.wav|43|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_175.wav|40|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_219.wav|10|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_372.wav|56|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_054.wav|62|The children are being very brave.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_280.wav|102|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_335.wav|53|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_158.wav|49|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_394.wav|13|But that title is a mistake.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_122.wav|34|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_286.wav|23|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_186.wav|7|Each case is treated on merit.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_109.wav|37|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_340.wav|0|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_358.wav|107|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_183.wav|56|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_388.wav|54|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_419.wav|20|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_151.wav|4|You just know it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_140.wav|98|We did not have a clue.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_033.wav|37|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_415.wav|79|We told them in July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_371.wav|32|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_290.wav|3|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_017.wav|90|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_048.wav|83|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_068.wav|55|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_314.wav|21|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_057.wav|82|He was between people and God.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_251.wav|70|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_330.wav|25|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_074.wav|75|We did it for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_341.wav|17|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_166.wav|69|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_182.wav|67|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_182.wav|106|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_352.wav|91|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_136.wav|70|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_261.wav|74|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_241.wav|22|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_404.wav|48|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_148.wav|57|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_132.wav|4|Did he always want to be a comedian?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_083.wav|93|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_102.wav|53|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_131.wav|17|David was not either.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_095.wav|12|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_430.wav|100|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_297.wav|15|There will be new memories.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_250.wav|29|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_338.wav|40|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_107.wav|36|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_351.wav|40|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_307.wav|76|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_020.wav|10|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_250.wav|3|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_115.wav|14|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_220.wav|7|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_197.wav|8|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_058.wav|96|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_309.wav|48|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_244.wav|49|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_176.wav|11|It was a day for records.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_174.wav|12|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_055.wav|62|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_284.wav|62|Knowledge is everything at this level.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_177.wav|39|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_067.wav|68|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_173.wav|42|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_417.wav|72|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_234.wav|87|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_278.wav|39|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_058.wav|68|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_231.wav|21|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_226.wav|93|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_209.wav|21|Children also died in Britain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_332.wav|25|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_166.wav|40|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_386.wav|56|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_226.wav|30|It is a form of physical exercise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_124.wav|35|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_065.wav|61|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_122.wav|63|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_255.wav|62|It lasted longer than we thought.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_116.wav|57|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_351.wav|12|This time, however, there is a new venue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_177.wav|62|They are going to carry it through.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_210.wav|85|We are in this for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_374.wav|98|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_299.wav|32|It is a flexible concept.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_077.wav|45|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_287.wav|102|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_219.wav|76|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_123.wav|56|It feels like a privilege.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_023.wav|83|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_352.wav|40|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_007.wav|17|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_204.wav|33|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_383.wav|36|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_176.wav|27|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_196.wav|54|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_136.wav|52|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_305.wav|72|I can't say that this is very usual.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_132.wav|78|It is hard to believe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_167.wav|21|Are his works inside out?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_267.wav|26|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_462.wav|50|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_241.wav|101|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_357.wav|21|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_362.wav|78|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_301.wav|68|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_231.wav|87|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_305.wav|23|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_393.wav|26|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_088.wav|37|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_248.wav|101|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_045.wav|71|"It's the same old story."
DUMMY2/p276/p276_363.wav|106|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_183.wav|61|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_292.wav|46|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_384.wav|100|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_331.wav|91|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_079.wav|9|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_178.wav|20|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_038.wav|32|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_057.wav|83|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_055.wav|43|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_240.wav|47|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_144.wav|2|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_054.wav|19|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_200.wav|38|We believe that the reason is poverty.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_297.wav|21|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_019.wav|30|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_201.wav|29|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_122.wav|29|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_281.wav|63|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_064.wav|38|He's very good at relating to adults.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_378.wav|48|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_062.wav|61|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_406.wav|92|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_072.wav|9|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_064.wav|32|There could be a way back.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_384.wav|13|This season has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_245.wav|18|It is very enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_038.wav|63|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_181.wav|16|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_359.wav|86|So I left.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_392.wav|84|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_372.wav|70|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_044.wav|39|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_017.wav|38|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_080.wav|105|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_385.wav|84|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_195.wav|79|You look at that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_003.wav|40|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_301.wav|79|Then it will come.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_427.wav|24|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_299.wav|103|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_450.wav|48|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_202.wav|81|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_029.wav|83|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_155.wav|82|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_216.wav|5|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_262.wav|35|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_041.wav|66|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_414.wav|107|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_041.wav|46|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_046.wav|44|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_235.wav|62|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_193.wav|79|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_412.wav|77|They are looking for profit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_395.wav|17|I don't think it's vital.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_386.wav|94|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_061.wav|73|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_002.wav|15|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_241.wav|72|We are now open.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_116.wav|53|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_016.wav|31|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_302.wav|12|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_137.wav|79|It was highly successful.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_338.wav|11|It was a matter of choice.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_137.wav|78|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_319.wav|46|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_241.wav|25|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_132.wav|96|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_122.wav|67|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_174.wav|82|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_255.wav|41|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_279.wav|28|That is where our future lies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_087.wav|47|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_042.wav|104|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_381.wav|17|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_127.wav|31|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_317.wav|4|But don't just take my word, for it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_336.wav|67|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_177.wav|6|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_396.wav|74|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_307.wav|84|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_069.wav|6|The show is not over.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_222.wav|76|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_149.wav|104|I'm sure that is not.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_296.wav|81|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_282.wav|44|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_246.wav|57|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_136.wav|54|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_187.wav|104|I want my mum.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_287.wav|22|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_069.wav|86|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_340.wav|95|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_005.wav|31|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_307.wav|42|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_012.wav|15|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_404.wav|52|My views on the decision are well known.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_326.wav|57|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_349.wav|63|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_113.wav|63|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_026.wav|105|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_203.wav|14|Because he was born in England.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_206.wav|33|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_139.wav|5|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_081.wav|39|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_460.wav|8|They're just a good retailer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_277.wav|86|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_060.wav|16|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_132.wav|84|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_224.wav|70|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_365.wav|50|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_117.wav|76|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_286.wav|7|You have got the evidence.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_274.wav|88|We are keen to have him back.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_407.wav|92|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_288.wav|89|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_161.wav|14|His second goal was equally impressive.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_079.wav|42|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_107.wav|42|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_247.wav|94|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_346.wav|93|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_382.wav|79|He certainly would have approved.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_299.wav|72|He will feel the pain again.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_193.wav|46|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_292.wav|65|It's just an area of water.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_116.wav|43|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_384.wav|16|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_102.wav|29|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_158.wav|22|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_023.wav|16|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_225.wav|51|The island will never recover.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_147.wav|74|It added to the spectacle.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_404.wav|56|She started to put on weight.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_361.wav|77|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_120.wav|42|Our lives have been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_308.wav|81|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_253.wav|17|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_417.wav|77|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_156.wav|45|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_045.wav|91|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_039.wav|51|His concern is only for the future.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_081.wav|92|We're just delighted to be back on top.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_308.wav|101|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_111.wav|80|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_356.wav|57|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_095.wav|81|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_032.wav|71|"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_361.wav|92|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_057.wav|70|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_009.wav|35|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_178.wav|70|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_375.wav|64|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_333.wav|87|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_055.wav|66|I've just got to do this.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_322.wav|9|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_130.wav|9|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_190.wav|53|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_356.wav|94|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_245.wav|51|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_073.wav|31|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_245.wav|63|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_030.wav|103|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_227.wav|63|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p274/p274_309.wav|32|Maloney is an engaging talent.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_286.wav|5|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_265.wav|71|"And Michael was just great."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_052.wav|18|But they were true stories.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_356.wav|14|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_282.wav|12|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_191.wav|107|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_192.wav|16|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_313.wav|53|For that reason cover should not be given.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_109.wav|15|A, The media has been great.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_151.wav|22|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_106.wav|104|The other conditions were not specified.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_229.wav|29|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_155.wav|4|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_275.wav|87|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_327.wav|60|That was the gimmick.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_002.wav|63|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_001.wav|97|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_102.wav|102|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_156.wav|33|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_242.wav|1|You would fall over, he said.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_381.wav|41|Face to face
DUMMY2/p362/p362_008.wav|15|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_051.wav|100|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_002.wav|35|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_009.wav|6|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_239.wav|93|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_420.wav|37|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_359.wav|70|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_040.wav|14|It is serious - but not that serious.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_219.wav|26|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_111.wav|66|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_134.wav|64|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_083.wav|96|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_285.wav|95|We need to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_064.wav|8|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_061.wav|94|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_058.wav|2|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_220.wav|68|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_043.wav|42|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_274.wav|1|All kinds of things occur.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_159.wav|74|It will not happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_026.wav|4|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_337.wav|103|We have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_271.wav|84|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_250.wav|65|We really are a team.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_167.wav|105|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_236.wav|1|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_059.wav|42|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_182.wav|31|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_167.wav|33|He is very confident at the moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_274.wav|33|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_211.wav|51|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_128.wav|86|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_174.wav|65|Now he's back on top again.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_266.wav|72|The look on his face was something special.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_242.wav|105|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_239.wav|107|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_483.wav|75|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_093.wav|67|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_290.wav|53|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_125.wav|52|I think there's not much between them.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_189.wav|46|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_252.wav|98|She has a little boy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_167.wav|12|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_195.wav|10|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_159.wav|102|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_216.wav|47|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_200.wav|40|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_146.wav|36|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_309.wav|89|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_190.wav|80|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_067.wav|43|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_321.wav|60|He has yet to receive a reply.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_236.wav|19|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_002.wav|94|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_186.wav|34|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_395.wav|85|That is not too bad.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_047.wav|99|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_182.wav|3|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_110.wav|0|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_204.wav|9|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_015.wav|104|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_070.wav|6|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_132.wav|77|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_262.wav|57|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_095.wav|58|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_232.wav|82|This is my homeland.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_211.wav|10|He is a good signing for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_315.wav|93|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_193.wav|10|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_220.wav|89|They must do it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_099.wav|90|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_263.wav|84|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_419.wav|104|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_232.wav|35|I was not sure whether I had won.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_263.wav|100|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_202.wav|4|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_189.wav|64|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_002.wav|1|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_111.wav|59|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_058.wav|7|We have to keep our clients.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_185.wav|76|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_001.wav|42|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_239.wav|62|I think it was his parents.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_194.wav|21|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_111.wav|50|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_295.wav|16|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_319.wav|82|Is she in trouble?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_460.wav|65|We have very limited capacity.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_097.wav|102|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_108.wav|46|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_375.wav|13|That's an equally important factor.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_123.wav|69|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_186.wav|19|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_142.wav|72|That's a pretty good percentage.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_374.wav|56|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_018.wav|98|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_349.wav|51|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_024.wav|81|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_155.wav|54|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_119.wav|6|Only the details have to be sorted out.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_320.wav|3|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_082.wav|97|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_324.wav|50|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_284.wav|29|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_188.wav|26|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_156.wav|40|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_432.wav|48|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_291.wav|78|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_277.wav|83|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_339.wav|59|I would miss him.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_182.wav|84|He will feel the pain again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_059.wav|63|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_114.wav|101|I told him I was a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_021.wav|47|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_023.wav|32|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p259/p259_434.wav|7|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_103.wav|49|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_154.wav|10|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_072.wav|36|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_237.wav|71|"You can feel at home in China."
DUMMY2/p273/p273_344.wav|56|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_045.wav|102|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_417.wav|46|There's nothing for you here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_280.wav|66|I hope my successor will do the same.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_037.wav|98|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_212.wav|40|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_366.wav|60|It will set the tone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_119.wav|49|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_020.wav|21|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_357.wav|32|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_283.wav|13|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_046.wav|3|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_129.wav|90|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_373.wav|16|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_083.wav|58|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_390.wav|75|She is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_392.wav|19|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_102.wav|20|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_045.wav|23|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_346.wav|15|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_153.wav|18|In fact, the reasons are simple.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_067.wav|8|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_326.wav|97|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_350.wav|25|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_288.wav|15|I don't see any problem.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_228.wav|62|It was no avail.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_204.wav|75|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_111.wav|92|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_102.wav|92|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_370.wav|38|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_402.wav|8|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_305.wav|74|We will not give up on the truth.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_324.wav|68|I'll go out and be aggressive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_123.wav|86|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_274.wav|93|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_124.wav|28|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_310.wav|46|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_203.wav|58|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_015.wav|45|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_383.wav|24|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_180.wav|29|That will apply to both sets of fans.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_332.wav|11|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_380.wav|93|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_087.wav|99|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_438.wav|65|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_058.wav|20|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_269.wav|60|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_406.wav|33|So it's a daily struggle.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_007.wav|47|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_167.wav|103|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_131.wav|9|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_413.wav|7|The director will be present.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_420.wav|77|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_008.wav|72|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_206.wav|83|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_162.wav|25|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_278.wav|14|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_228.wav|106|I would not say that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_226.wav|43|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_264.wav|40|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_176.wav|71|"We are very concerned about controller fatigue."
DUMMY2/p333/p333_145.wav|64|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_017.wav|27|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_283.wav|39|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_125.wav|89|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_215.wav|26|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_036.wav|100|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_281.wav|19|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_287.wav|49|Others were even less confident.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_183.wav|69|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_198.wav|89|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_228.wav|51|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_332.wav|35|I can see their argument.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_365.wav|39|There is a range of employers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_090.wav|97|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_343.wav|65|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_309.wav|58|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_405.wav|48|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_171.wav|59|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_138.wav|37|Monty is great in his own backyard.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_042.wav|20|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_211.wav|101|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_045.wav|94|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_198.wav|72|He was tough and relentless.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_076.wav|91|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_340.wav|59|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_043.wav|9|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_306.wav|28|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_147.wav|80|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_068.wav|32|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_038.wav|56|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_147.wav|91|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_312.wav|72|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_100.wav|26|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_300.wav|97|This is the start of a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_168.wav|40|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_173.wav|44|We're all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_385.wav|64|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_214.wav|61|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_092.wav|47|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_257.wav|67|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_057.wav|57|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_179.wav|57|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_133.wav|100|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_449.wav|63|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.

DUMMY2/p335/p335_018.wav|49|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_282.wav|31|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_230.wav|40|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_332.wav|52|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_307.wav|98|It is a daunting task.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_156.wav|101|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_195.wav|96|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_315.wav|8|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_042.wav|82|You can see how he made his money.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_180.wav|104|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_262.wav|70|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_230.wav|42|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_452.wav|65|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_175.wav|60|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_244.wav|89|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_363.wav|49|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_085.wav|44|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_193.wav|104|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_081.wav|61|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_062.wav|75|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_068.wav|29|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_072.wav|48|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_068.wav|98|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_116.wav|31|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_271.wav|6|That should not be their conclusion.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_080.wav|80|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_101.wav|1|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_393.wav|102|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_419.wav|54|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_038.wav|7|It all started with a visiting rugby club.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_361.wav|58|What's happening to her?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_303.wav|66|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_282.wav|41|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_106.wav|9|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_107.wav|72|Our children are the future of our society.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_124.wav|93|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_202.wav|101|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_150.wav|96|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_093.wav|24|The excitement could hardly be contained.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_088.wav|26|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_420.wav|46|I just want to get rid of it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_318.wav|39|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_098.wav|49|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_060.wav|98|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_397.wav|41|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_333.wav|20|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_149.wav|56|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_062.wav|22|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_246.wav|40|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_201.wav|43|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_377.wav|91|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_428.wav|48|Or maybe it's the other way around.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_035.wav|61|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_392.wav|92|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_201.wav|75|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_391.wav|79|Everything is coming together well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_403.wav|60|It has great potential.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_353.wav|22|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_319.wav|105|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_093.wav|79|I knew him a little.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_100.wav|68|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_389.wav|100|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_165.wav|27|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_012.wav|66|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_287.wav|36|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_089.wav|92|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_051.wav|107|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_156.wav|26|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_168.wav|86|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_053.wav|30|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_349.wav|49|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_079.wav|66|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_388.wav|2|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_015.wav|56|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_059.wav|68|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_378.wav|79|I have never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_369.wav|13|I'm delighted for Andy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_018.wav|96|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_359.wav|78|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_166.wav|98|Nobody could survive on that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_392.wav|89|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_353.wav|53|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_085.wav|99|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_125.wav|5|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_444.wav|24|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_089.wav|91|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_093.wav|41|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_150.wav|9|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_358.wav|15|It is having a big impact.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_131.wav|19|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_342.wav|56|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_271.wav|71|"It was a privilege to work for him."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_397.wav|21|I have hardly any commitments.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_284.wav|20|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_348.wav|5|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_390.wav|15|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_093.wav|56|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_193.wav|61|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_289.wav|55|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_054.wav|52|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_263.wav|104|A statement is expected in April.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_113.wav|54|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_289.wav|12|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_211.wav|34|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_321.wav|14|A Home Office spokesman said.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_244.wav|72|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_042.wav|62|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_188.wav|106|She is in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_053.wav|97|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_256.wav|68|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_016.wav|101|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_172.wav|99|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_051.wav|54|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_268.wav|98|We're all going to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_152.wav|89|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_310.wav|47|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_123.wav|4|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_234.wav|13|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_115.wav|10|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_295.wav|2|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_115.wav|47|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_168.wav|107|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_288.wav|38|It's the taking part that counts.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_051.wav|82|It was time to act.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_209.wav|14|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_277.wav|33|I don't take that view.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_058.wav|54|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_179.wav|86|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_303.wav|53|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_398.wav|103|The issue has still to be resolved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_168.wav|92|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_250.wav|5|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_360.wav|99|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_345.wav|92|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_327.wav|49|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_032.wav|107|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_367.wav|93|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_117.wav|79|He was taken ill in his office.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_379.wav|42|Everyone has his share of trouble.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_176.wav|6|Her body has never been found.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_194.wav|92|Defeat is simply not an option.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_025.wav|28|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_006.wav|88|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_285.wav|70|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_056.wav|17|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_295.wav|34|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_145.wav|97|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_190.wav|95|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_253.wav|6|I sit in the car.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_269.wav|55|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_202.wav|1|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_038.wav|98|IT is a terrible equation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_137.wav|71|"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_086.wav|96|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_325.wav|10|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_050.wav|12|Except for this, it was offside.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_125.wav|41|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_143.wav|76|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_330.wav|98|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_021.wav|52|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_032.wav|103|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_171.wav|103|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_389.wav|11|It was good today.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_265.wav|102|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_421.wav|19|It appears to have been closed down.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_261.wav|81|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_175.wav|50|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_185.wav|14|City sentiment is in his favour.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_251.wav|62|All would be under threat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_238.wav|15|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_219.wav|82|I am going to fight to the end.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_302.wav|105|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_227.wav|29|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_367.wav|85|It is based on his movement records.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_074.wav|82|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_016.wav|94|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_215.wav|104|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_401.wav|52|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_165.wav|82|We don't have a solution to the problem.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_178.wav|89|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_128.wav|16|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_078.wav|64|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_061.wav|28|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_123.wav|83|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_079.wav|70|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_271.wav|64|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_392.wav|105|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_010.wav|6|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_143.wav|96|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_333.wav|84|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_197.wav|52|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_106.wav|91|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_162.wav|66|I'm working on that.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_104.wav|92|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_354.wav|12|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_027.wav|14|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_067.wav|45|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_212.wav|99|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_073.wav|53|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_272.wav|104|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_098.wav|68|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_150.wav|25|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_206.wav|67|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_355.wav|2|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_161.wav|79|You can see the appeal of running away.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_026.wav|97|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_176.wav|100|It is a body blow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_200.wav|48|It's been a humbling year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_074.wav|105|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_360.wav|5|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_266.wav|29|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_420.wav|32|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_257.wav|95|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_173.wav|100|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_217.wav|51|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_306.wav|105|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_145.wav|46|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_352.wav|1|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_093.wav|83|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_320.wav|49|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_136.wav|103|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_196.wav|65|What do they want us to do?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_401.wav|25|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_131.wav|41|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_342.wav|27|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_121.wav|73|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_397.wav|70|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_365.wav|38|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p347/p347_242.wav|46|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_197.wav|9|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_033.wav|92|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_254.wav|77|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_290.wav|100|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_225.wav|36|We're very unhappy about it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_331.wav|28|He did, and he missed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_026.wav|45|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_002.wav|4|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_376.wav|76|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_404.wav|65|It was that kind of match.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_330.wav|7|No Briton has ever won.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_264.wav|2|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_203.wav|82|No, it's never been mentioned.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_263.wav|43|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_075.wav|9|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_053.wav|80|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_336.wav|54|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_100.wav|4|It is quite a new prescription.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_036.wav|79|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_132.wav|42|But that's not the idea behind this article.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_404.wav|20|It's an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_270.wav|5|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_277.wav|60|I have no further comment to make.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_282.wav|81|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_323.wav|10|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_280.wav|36|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_273.wav|26|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_369.wav|58|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_127.wav|11|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_092.wav|97|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_078.wav|27|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_413.wav|27|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_015.wav|65|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p310/p310_276.wav|17|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_194.wav|62|However, we came through.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_263.wav|68|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_169.wav|6|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_169.wav|33|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_085.wav|66|She added, It is a huge problem.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_418.wav|62|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_087.wav|38|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_131.wav|91|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_211.wav|72|I sincerely hope that will not change.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_013.wav|19|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_237.wav|91|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_097.wav|46|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_070.wav|3|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_134.wav|2|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_315.wav|95|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_184.wav|74|But that is not an issue for now.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_104.wav|48|I am so proud of him.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_058.wav|77|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_188.wav|90|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_371.wav|92|She makes me feel very proud.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_238.wav|94|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_049.wav|39|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_220.wav|82|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_224.wav|93|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_369.wav|104|But it would change the context.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_001.wav|52|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_378.wav|66|And it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_166.wav|78|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_103.wav|66|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_202.wav|65|I was independent but I am not now.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_220.wav|1|Ordering online was very easy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_356.wav|37|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_234.wav|69|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_118.wav|57|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_028.wav|2|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_367.wav|2|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_142.wav|88|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_352.wav|35|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_040.wav|103|We know you will not let us down.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_233.wav|30|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_258.wav|54|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_076.wav|82|But her parents will never see her again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_261.wav|0|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_121.wav|65|All music goes into me.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_051.wav|99|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_157.wav|54|We have all been shocked by her death.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_004.wav|33|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_322.wav|23|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_142.wav|83|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_036.wav|89|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_203.wav|32|If it doesn't, it doesn't.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_098.wav|34|They are not suitable.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_030.wav|62|I've got the poster.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_329.wav|22|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_002.wav|43|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_242.wav|90|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_322.wav|100|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_077.wav|24|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_070.wav|41|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_127.wav|10|We had another last Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_076.wav|39|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_176.wav|70|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_120.wav|36|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_327.wav|69|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_139.wav|10|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_057.wav|26|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_288.wav|49|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_036.wav|44|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_394.wav|75|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_385.wav|68|This is the first stage of catching up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_383.wav|42|And it's time for new leadership.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_009.wav|21|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_167.wav|96|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_228.wav|52|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_195.wav|86|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_352.wav|77|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_367.wav|14|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_258.wav|47|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_189.wav|21|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_184.wav|84|Is Saddam a threat ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_033.wav|27|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_028.wav|67|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_045.wav|59|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_071.wav|23|So the challenge is against ourselves.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_235.wav|22|Correction, knowing him, he might.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_354.wav|28|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_371.wav|79|Well, you don't have time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_311.wav|4|This is new money.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_026.wav|48|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_144.wav|10|I have always loved the countryside.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_069.wav|106|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_124.wav|71|"Some of the characters will not be played by humans."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_180.wav|82|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_188.wav|82|Everything in the world was focused on London.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_021.wav|51|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_268.wav|81|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_385.wav|48|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_056.wav|37|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_276.wav|60|They might well be right.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_307.wav|77|There is no evidence for that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_416.wav|60|It's not an impression.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_253.wav|104|We don't want to be too intrusive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_079.wav|38|Maybe that was the whole point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_141.wav|11|Where is the logic in that?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_322.wav|10|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_086.wav|11|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_163.wav|64|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_127.wav|88|He was extremely ill.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_016.wav|3|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_068.wav|70|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_111.wav|68|Only the scale of change differed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_417.wav|32|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_219.wav|87|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_087.wav|100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_409.wav|55|Five local people were injured.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_169.wav|87|There were no plans for a rights issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_262.wav|92|The committees are due to report next year.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_156.wav|36|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_302.wav|5|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_467.wav|24|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_419.wav|65|We didn't really have to power up.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_051.wav|25|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_196.wav|24|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_043.wav|45|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_083.wav|39|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_272.wav|49|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_133.wav|78|Or it would have been.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_202.wav|92|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_139.wav|40|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_060.wav|62|We just wish they had done so before.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_233.wav|68|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_396.wav|42|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_146.wav|83|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_318.wav|52|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_104.wav|79|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_235.wav|65|After the match, do you?)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_352.wav|70|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_021.wav|97|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_196.wav|72|I see that any day now.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_220.wav|97|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_006.wav|30|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_448.wav|24|The people around me were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_040.wav|39|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_093.wav|97|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_248.wav|49|I am deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_057.wav|44|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_268.wav|95|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_100.wav|95|It really was an unusual award.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_352.wav|45|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_264.wav|1|He will decide tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_374.wav|62|It's such a tragedy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_191.wav|59|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_302.wav|26|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_011.wav|92|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_090.wav|68|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_301.wav|95|This is a total mystery.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_311.wav|48|Celtic were the losers then.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_298.wav|53|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_134.wav|50|You're a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_186.wav|67|Is Saddam a threat ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_243.wav|40|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_055.wav|8|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_187.wav|7|It is only the beginning.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_072.wav|15|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_220.wav|96|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_109.wav|49|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_046.wav|106|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_045.wav|24|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_006.wav|4|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_066.wav|41|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_309.wav|31|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_219.wav|42|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_009.wav|59|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_334.wav|27|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_058.wav|52|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_157.wav|97|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_404.wav|27|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_026.wav|31|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_090.wav|12|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_183.wav|13|Progress is being made but it is slow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_334.wav|73|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_242.wav|86|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_314.wav|17|Boarding school was equally protective.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_291.wav|83|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_311.wav|69|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_146.wav|50|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_386.wav|74|It will be a new experience.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_132.wav|75|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_105.wav|97|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_042.wav|29|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_020.wav|87|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_305.wav|64|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_317.wav|56|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_224.wav|83|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_395.wav|46|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_073.wav|62|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_307.wav|52|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_314.wav|11|I am not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_051.wav|37|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_236.wav|40|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_320.wav|20|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_342.wav|89|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_175.wav|87|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_364.wav|15|Cooking is intricate and complex.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_124.wav|77|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_307.wav|74|Now they had it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_109.wav|16|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_251.wav|20|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_115.wav|93|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_228.wav|63|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_102.wav|84|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_178.wav|16|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_198.wav|99|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_071.wav|58|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_244.wav|70|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_400.wav|82|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_103.wav|107|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_012.wav|76|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_199.wav|94|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_274.wav|96|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_088.wav|77|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_261.wav|84|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_348.wav|64|So now you know.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_227.wav|94|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_010.wav|55|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_446.wav|27|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_361.wav|43|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_308.wav|70|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_308.wav|30|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_452.wav|37|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_245.wav|64|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_225.wav|87|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_266.wav|0|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_028.wav|26|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_371.wav|72|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_103.wav|27|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_026.wav|103|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_193.wav|42|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_029.wav|57|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_224.wav|46|You can never tell.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_024.wav|50|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_173.wav|28|Its first awards will do just that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_263.wav|85|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_383.wav|58|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_304.wav|95|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_111.wav|91|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_066.wav|85|I wouldn't give them a grade.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_168.wav|34|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_096.wav|5|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_414.wav|96|I was very young.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_144.wav|87|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_212.wav|19|But there's no eye contact.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_205.wav|41|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_211.wav|93|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_181.wav|49|Our customers come first.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_015.wav|1|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_166.wav|45|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_268.wav|37|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_243.wav|58|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_419.wav|64|They were in good humour, too.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_112.wav|62|I believe he could have turned it around.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_364.wav|45|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_050.wav|58|I've just got to do this.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_256.wav|96|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_291.wav|57|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_204.wav|74|Why does he do it?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_017.wav|96|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_363.wav|7|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_079.wav|104|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_308.wav|40|You should be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_087.wav|20|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_348.wav|79|And that was the real problem.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_268.wav|22|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_005.wav|87|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_129.wav|99|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_009.wav|97|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_250.wav|31|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_423.wav|33|I'm going to take it further.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_118.wav|2|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_316.wav|103|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_407.wav|11|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_062.wav|27|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_476.wav|65|Tell us about it.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_215.wav|58|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_223.wav|95|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_325.wav|56|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_347.wav|4|I've no problem with what they said.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_287.wav|38|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_316.wav|104|We all make mistakes.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_069.wav|77|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_160.wav|23|The only answer is a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_371.wav|53|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_235.wav|67|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_410.wav|46|It was a stunning strike.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_037.wav|12|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_180.wav|71|"I have no sympathy with her at all."
DUMMY2/p311/p311_275.wav|4|He will do very well.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_131.wav|8|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_038.wav|78|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_007.wav|94|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_250.wav|60|It is part of his game.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_151.wav|83|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_284.wav|54|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_196.wav|31|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_255.wav|100|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_380.wav|36|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_015.wav|49|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_142.wav|11|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_108.wav|98|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_118.wav|97|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_469.wav|7|It was like someone had died.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_343.wav|64|He was different from the rest of us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_135.wav|58|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_340.wav|10|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_190.wav|58|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_091.wav|6|We have not given up.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_274.wav|70|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_404.wav|96|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_051.wav|97|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_253.wav|85|Why do it?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_151.wav|91|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_240.wav|90|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_245.wav|20|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_191.wav|51|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_222.wav|62|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_254.wav|80|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_193.wav|80|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_329.wav|25|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_358.wav|38|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_137.wav|84|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_171.wav|23|At this point we can only speculate.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_290.wav|10|I understand the security issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_307.wav|99|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_271.wav|100|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_181.wav|85|But this relative success has not been easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_266.wav|22|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_141.wav|79|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_474.wav|75|He was a shooting star.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_079.wav|25|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_246.wav|36|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_320.wav|90|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_292.wav|52|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_302.wav|94|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_266.wav|2|We are happy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_200.wav|105|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_021.wav|13|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_299.wav|80|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_403.wav|54|It is not an abortion.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_204.wav|34|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_129.wav|93|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_197.wav|77|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_396.wav|41|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_392.wav|48|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_087.wav|11|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_379.wav|82|And therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_060.wav|68|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_143.wav|56|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_346.wav|82|Spent three months alone at sea.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_097.wav|49|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_245.wav|24|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_347.wav|107|The princess has had other health problems.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_199.wav|33|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_338.wav|7|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_286.wav|106|Their extinction is not inevitable.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_359.wav|6|They never seem to do anything about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_281.wav|62|They were totally behind it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_392.wav|4|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_058.wav|21|The matter will come up again.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_182.wav|58|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_231.wav|40|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_318.wav|38|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_136.wav|18|I am not inclined to believe it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_391.wav|87|This is a load of nonsense.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_143.wav|93|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_269.wav|94|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_079.wav|84|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_231.wav|13|This action could have been avoided.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_295.wav|42|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_025.wav|72|So we will cut their numbers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_013.wav|50|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_071.wav|52|It turned me against the whole system.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_083.wav|81|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_037.wav|53|That was not perfect golf by any means.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_061.wav|32|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_239.wav|96|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_193.wav|85|It's to do with this place.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_017.wav|11|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_120.wav|44|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_064.wav|81|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_027.wav|30|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_132.wav|90|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_375.wav|46|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_137.wav|90|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_378.wav|52|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_236.wav|93|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_058.wav|47|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_264.wav|45|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_053.wav|55|By all accounts he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_291.wav|52|He would get into any world team.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_284.wav|94|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_124.wav|22|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_224.wav|10|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_307.wav|75|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_083.wav|57|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_200.wav|4|Can you believe it?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_091.wav|16|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_232.wav|106|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_053.wav|74|Don't you believe it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_349.wav|4|I think we have got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_146.wav|106|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_232.wav|75|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_413.wav|107|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_113.wav|72|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_183.wav|91|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_171.wav|82|It is a hobby for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_389.wav|26|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_416.wav|32|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_009.wav|54|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_348.wav|96|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_173.wav|105|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_290.wav|58|Are his works inside out?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_161.wav|95|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_209.wav|44|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_324.wav|24|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_182.wav|75|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_067.wav|100|That's not the intention at all.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_462.wav|63|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p227/p227_393.wav|29|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_296.wav|76|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_392.wav|67|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_157.wav|47|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_009.wav|62|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_415.wav|76|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_120.wav|11|That's not going to happen again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_397.wav|0|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_205.wav|48|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_118.wav|60|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_099.wav|26|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_113.wav|77|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_217.wav|36|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_208.wav|69|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_182.wav|55|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_426.wav|8|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_285.wav|63|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_267.wav|94|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_183.wav|47|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_350.wav|33|It will make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_018.wav|43|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_099.wav|59|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_168.wav|18|I would like to make an impact, of course.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_006.wav|83|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_070.wav|43|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_089.wav|90|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_001.wav|63|Please call Stella.

DUMMY2/p226/p226_303.wav|43|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_259.wav|40|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_405.wav|14|The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_166.wav|85|It certainly sounded it at times.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_270.wav|24|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_257.wav|92|Controllers major concern is safety.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_069.wav|50|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_275.wav|66|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_029.wav|48|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_059.wav|101|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_258.wav|85|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_134.wav|44|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_285.wav|60|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_261.wav|32|You can feel at home in China.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_336.wav|51|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_209.wav|62|Of course he was right!
DUMMY2/p298/p298_053.wav|68|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_163.wav|6|I live for today.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_270.wav|34|What do you think of the hair?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_334.wav|23|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_044.wav|14|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_253.wav|102|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_141.wav|9|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_037.wav|107|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_246.wav|0|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_128.wav|26|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_083.wav|51|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_062.wav|11|This year the exercise is being repeated.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_196.wav|87|Everyone around the club was supportive.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_093.wav|22|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_210.wav|26|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_015.wav|100|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_412.wav|7|It sounds like a wish list.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_092.wav|20|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_185.wav|21|Of course, there was still much to be done.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_050.wav|52|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_272.wav|75|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_349.wav|87|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_187.wav|79|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_006.wav|24|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_157.wav|85|I understood that concern.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_407.wav|55|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_163.wav|9|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_125.wav|47|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_466.wav|32|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_042.wav|94|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_386.wav|27|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_133.wav|66|There was no hint of bravado.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_301.wav|107|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_137.wav|32|It's going to take some time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_008.wav|56|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_029.wav|37|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_266.wav|79|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_015.wav|73|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_272.wav|30|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_006.wav|62|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_237.wav|16|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_097.wav|32|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_063.wav|67|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_037.wav|11|He didn't want me to leave the house.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_363.wav|40|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_040.wav|94|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_283.wav|10|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_129.wav|73|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_394.wav|48|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_326.wav|50|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_447.wav|14|That will be best for him.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_081.wav|80|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_097.wav|34|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_288.wav|6|The Believer isn't just a movie.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_079.wav|45|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_410.wav|7|The team hadn't been picked.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_376.wav|33|But what lies ahead?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_129.wav|62|His remit is specific.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_026.wav|12|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_317.wav|11|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_404.wav|70|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_110.wav|50|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_107.wav|24|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_414.wav|42|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_012.wav|93|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_230.wav|24|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_198.wav|17|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_183.wav|54|We are expected to do better than before.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_085.wav|30|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_230.wav|103|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_167.wav|40|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_426.wav|105|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_275.wav|59|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_150.wav|77|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_167.wav|16|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_279.wav|84|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_249.wav|18|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_118.wav|69|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_066.wav|65|She always put the party first.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_124.wav|29|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_374.wav|19|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_242.wav|43|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_273.wav|46|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_133.wav|69|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_302.wav|82|It's a gigantic con.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_193.wav|69|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_345.wav|26|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_270.wav|95|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_030.wav|75|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_457.wav|7|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_176.wav|75|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_094.wav|74|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_068.wav|93|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_270.wav|53|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_206.wav|78|We can take the city.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_206.wav|55|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_118.wav|61|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_249.wav|90|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_090.wav|6|But someone has got to do it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_399.wav|74|I reported it but nothing was done.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_396.wav|24|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_248.wav|47|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_008.wav|24|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_153.wav|42|That's my big challenge.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_009.wav|27|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_181.wav|6|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_306.wav|106|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_185.wav|43|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_458.wav|65|The technology looks excellent.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_368.wav|6|We have a business to run.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_336.wav|72|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_287.wav|48|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_184.wav|107|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_039.wav|22|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_009.wav|84|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_254.wav|17|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_242.wav|54|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_187.wav|4|Another man said, It was horrible.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_199.wav|22|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_032.wav|34|Leisure centres were also affected.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_463.wav|89|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_134.wav|11|They are a good team.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_199.wav|25|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_073.wav|78|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_286.wav|94|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_183.wav|12|This one was my best chance.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_232.wav|8|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_145.wav|26|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_271.wav|59|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_278.wav|105|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_343.wav|75|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_303.wav|22|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_052.wav|52|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_086.wav|0|They need to find a form of words.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_054.wav|11|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_141.wav|80|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_077.wav|3|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_121.wav|106|I am not very pleased.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_375.wav|84|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_156.wav|72|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_070.wav|31|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_021.wav|105|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_222.wav|39|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_056.wav|41|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_331.wav|56|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_035.wav|76|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_107.wav|47|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_414.wav|103|He was not seeking special advantage.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_236.wav|10|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_157.wav|89|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_354.wav|42|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_162.wav|7|There's only one team in Ayrshire.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_362.wav|93|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_342.wav|82|He is already in place.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_336.wav|14|Then followed a bout of flu.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_227.wav|96|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_131.wav|10|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_280.wav|74|The director's a genius.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_197.wav|86|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_401.wav|107|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_220.wav|10|The only problem was the greens.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_200.wav|39|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_051.wav|77|It depends on the couple.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_405.wav|79|We are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_066.wav|2|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_062.wav|18|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_150.wav|28|Yet it does not lose appeal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_375.wav|14|They have broken that promise.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_118.wav|23|These are long-term investments.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_091.wav|73|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_065.wav|98|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_339.wav|76|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_003.wav|100|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_036.wav|104|Michael, he is running!
DUMMY2/p305/p305_259.wav|54|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_195.wav|2|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_271.wav|4|They didn't find any substance.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_112.wav|2|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_279.wav|37|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_390.wav|55|I'm not sure that's right.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_302.wav|15|But we all have to look at ourselves.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_117.wav|13|They offered to make an investment into it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_307.wav|107|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_095.wav|5|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_227.wav|93|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_121.wav|14|That might help a bit.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_006.wav|1|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_259.wav|18|The memory is there.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_056.wav|69|They were on holiday in Egypt.
